		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8" value="THE DISCOURSE OF ATHANASIUS, ARCHBISHOP OF RAKOTE, ON MERCY AND JUDGEMENT."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan103" value="The world which hath no remembrance of God, O my brethren, is governed by the injustice which appertaineth to cruelty, and by the inhumanity which appertaineth to weakness,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan231" value="even as the holy Apostle spake saying, ‘According as God did not think fit to let them remain in a state of rectitude, God gave them over to hardheartedness, and to the doing of the things which were unseemly.’"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan394" value="And they worked injustice of every kind; and wickedness, and evil, and deeds of avarice; and they were filled with calumnies and murder, and with contention, and the cunningness of the evil heart of the informer and of the tale-bearer; and with the works of the debaucher, which are hateful to God; "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan562" value="and with the pride of the babbler of foolish things, and of him that seeketh to find out the things which are evil;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan606" value="And they hearkened not to the words of their parents; and were fools, and men without belief; and were arrogant, without mercy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan691" value="These are they whom God converted to the worship of God, and He teacheth them also to depart from that which is evil, and to have merciful care for him that is his neighbour,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan837" value=" according to that which Isaiah taught us, saying in the character of God, 'Cease ye from the things which are evil, learn to do that which is good.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan942" value="Now the Law containeth a very large number of precepts which do injury to him that is our neighbour, but there are also therein commandments concerning charity (or, the love of men), and the doing of deeds of mercy to each other."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1083" value="Now if it happen that a man omitteth (to keep) one of those precepts, it will not be sufficient for him to put another in its place;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1175" value="neither will the man be acceptable before God who doeth good with that which is gained from the profits of injustice,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1275" value=" if he give nothing of the things which he himself possesseth, because even the men who do unjust things make the attempt to offer up gifts of their own goods to God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1395" value="For it is written, ‘The sacrifice of wicked men is an abomination unto God.’ Therefore concerning him that sheweth himself to be without mercy doth He (i.e., the Book) say, 'Unto him that shutteth his ears, and hearkeneth not unto the poor, God will not hearken when he maketh his appeal to Him.’"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1574" value="Therefore hath the Book of Proverbs counselled us saying, ' Give thou to God of thy labour in truth, and thou shalt give Him the firstfruits of thy righteousness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1695" value="Now supposing thou didst give a gift to God of a part of something which had been obtained by thee through injustice or plunder, thy gift would not be very acceptable to Him either because thou hadst obtained that something by injustice or plunder, or because thou wast giving a portion of it to Him as a gift. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1855" value="For thou must bring as thine offering the gift which is pure, even as it is written, 'The offerings of the upright are acceptable unto Him.’"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1956" value="And moreover, if thou dost acquire possessions through thine honest labour, thou shalt bring unto God offerings from the same, whereon the poor shall feed themselves, yet they shall be accounted unto you as things plundered,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2102" value=" according to that which He spake by the prophet Malachi saying, 'The firstfruits and tithes are stolen by you, and the plunder shall be in your houses.’ "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2208" value="Now it is meet for us to mingle mercy with judgement, and we must acquire the faculty of judging, but we must speak in mercy, according to that which is written, 'Keep mercy and judgement, and do thou draw nigh unto thy God at all times.’"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2400" value="For God loveth mercy and judgement, and let him draw nigh unto God Who careth (for the poor) in mercy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2498" value="Finally, let each one of us now in this place (i.e., world) examine himself."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2553" value="Let the rich man consider most carefully concerning the things which he hath gotten, and among which he considereth the gifts of God to be, whether he hath acted unjustly towards the poor man, or whether he hath taken advantage of his weakness, or whether he hath claimed more than his share of that which belongeth to him, (or whether) he hath employed force (in his dealing with him) instead of righteousness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2782" value="Now we are commanded, in respect of our servants, to keep strict justice when dealing with them, and to treat them equitably."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2855" value="Because thou hast the power (to deal unjustly), do not practise injustice; and because thou art able (to defraud), do not claim more than thy share on the contrary, because thou hast the works of power, do thou make manifest the works of righteousness. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3003" value="For it is not a matter which it is impossible for thee to perform."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3046" value="Thou art obliged to give a proof of the obedience and fear which are in thee in respect of God, but in that wherein thou hast the power to transgress, thou shalt not transgress."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3172" value="Supposing thou didst carry off the tools of certain poor men, and didst give them to other poor men, thou wouldst be acceptable neither for thy theft nor for thy gift. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3274" value="Why shouldst thou pollute thy riches and bring upon them works which are unrighteous?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3347" value="Why shouldst thou make thine offering to be an abomination (to God) by undertaking to offer up an offering of injustice, because thou thinkest to do a kindness to other poor men with it?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3457" value="Be merciful unto that man who hath suffered injustice."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3501" value=" Do deeds of kindness and charity to this man, and act with gracious goodness to that man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3552" value="Thou shalt thereby perform mercy and judgement."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3594" value="For God doth not make Himself a partner in greediness, neither doth He share with thieves and robbers. It is not impossible for Him to feed the poor whom He hath committed unto us, but He requireth the fruitfulness of righteousness, and the love of men, at our hands, whereby we shall be both of use to others, and do good to ourselves."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3848" value="Mercy hath no existence in injustice, neither hath blessing any existence in cursing, nor doth the doing of acts of kindness spring from the tears of those who weep."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3959" value="For God spake concerning the tears that moved Him of those who were treated unjustly, saying, 'These are the things that ye do which I hate. Ye cover over (or, dress) My altar with tears, and weeping, and sighings which arise from sufferings.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4143" value="Acts of this kind performed in this manner are works of vanity, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4192" value="and they are performed for the sake of the approbation of men, and not for the approbation which is from God. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4270" value="It was for this reason that the Lord rightly said, ‘Do not your acts (of charity) in order that men may see you.’"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4339" value="For if thou wouldst do thy works of charity so that it shall be God alone Who knoweth thereof, thou wilt guard thyself from doing them in greediness (or, avarice), for thou knowest that thou wilt not please in this manner God, who watcheth us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4516" value="Let us perform our acts of charity in such a manner that we may receive the reward therefore from God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4582" value="Now though God giveth His good gifts unto these whom He honoureth, He honoureth in no way whatsoever him that seizeth more than his share."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4672" value="Refrain from making an offering unto God if thou causest grief to thy brother."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4736" value="For he (i. e., the Book) saith, 'If thou goest to offer up an offering upon the altar, thou shalt remember in that place if thy brother hath any matter against thee. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4827" value="(If he hath), go forth first of all and make thyself to be at peace with thy brother, and then come in and offer up thy gift.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4898" value="Remember then Zacchaeus, the tax-gatherer, who determined to restore to him that had been defrauded his property twofold"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4985" value="And in this way he divided his possessions among the poor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5029" value="For he knew that he wished to receive Christ into (his house), and that Christ would only receive unto Himself those who gave gladly unto the poor, (and that He would not receive him) unless he did away with his avariciousness, and the things which he had acquired unjustly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5212" value="And in this manner did the Lord receive in integrity Zacchaeus"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5269" value="Who said, 'Salvation is in this my house this day.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5321" value="And these things we would say unto those who do works of charity, but who do not take care to be scrupulously fair and just."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5407" value="And we would also say them unto him that keepeth strict watch on himself in respect of committing acts of injustice, but is careless in respect of doing works of charity, ‘The tree which beareth not fruit they cut down and cast into the fire."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5550" value="In this manner this tree will never give pleasure to the Husbandman Who appertaineth to heaven, Who spake saying, 'I came seeking for fruit on this fig-tree, and I have found none"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5696" value="and He commanded (them) to cut it down so that it might not make the ground to be without value also.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5743" value="And they are also wont to condemn him that giveth no pledge to the poor, and there is a threat of punishment because of this in the following (words)"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5838" value="for He saith, 'He who forgetteth to give a pledge to the poor shall cry out to God, and He will not hearken unto him.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5937" value="And God saith, 'For I am the Merciful One.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5976" value="Now, it is a terrible thing, and a matter wholly outside the Law, for thee to come back and reap thy fields a second time, or for thee to come back and gather grapes a second time from thy vineyard, or for thee to come back and gather fruit a second time from thine olive trees; for it is meet that thou shouldst leave these for the poor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6168" value="If now these commandments were given unto those who were under the Law, what shall we say in respect of these who are under Christ? "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6259" value="These are the (words) which the Lord spake saying, 'Except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and the Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the kingdom which is in the heavens.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6383" value="Therefore (we must give) not only from our fields, and from that which cometh into us, but also of the work of our hands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6476" value="And the Apostle taught us that we must give unto those who have nothing at all,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6529" value="for he spake saying, 'Ye shall accept the good things in order that ye may find the wherewithal to give gifts to him that is needy.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6597" value="Unto him that wisheth to follow in the steps of the Saviour will the Lord reveal His Divine Person, and He will make him to give of all his substance, and to do that which is good to the poor; and in this wise he shall follow in His footsteps."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6753" value="Now, those who follow in His footsteps, and those who are perfect, give effect wholly to the great and perfect readiness (to give) which is in charity. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6854" value="He gave them this commandment in order that they should perform service by means of (their) possessions, and should convert the remnant also to the service by the Word and the Spirit."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6959" value="He gave them this commandment in order to make them do acts of beneficence, and to give gifts for the common good, and to continue to do so with what they had, so that through these things they might find themselves to be like unto the love which God hath for man, and might do works of charity, and give thanks."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7150" value="For He spake saying, 'Give and it shall be given unto you. Be merciful and mercy shall be shewed unto you.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7225" value="Through the things of this earth, moreover, He promised to them a share in those things which are with Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7286" value="For these are they who shall take their stand at the right hand of God, and these are they unto whom the King, when He shall come, shall speak saying, ' Come, ye blessed of My Father, and ye shall inherit the kingdom which hath been prepared for you from the foundation of the world. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7448" value="For I was hungry, (and) ye gave Me food."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7481" value=" I was thirsty, (and) ye gave Me water to drink. I was a stranger, (and) ye took Me to yourselves. I was hungry, (and) ye gave Me food. I was thirsty, (and) ye gave Me water to drink. I was a stranger, (and) ye took Me to yourselves."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7551" value="I was naked, (and) ye clothed Me. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7584" value="I was sick, (and) ye visited Me. I was in prison, (and) ye came unto Me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7657" value="Then the righteous, having marvelled (at these words), shall say, 'Lord, at what time did we ever do these things unto Thee?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7753" value="And He shall say unto them, ' Amen. I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these few little ones, it is to Me that ye have done these things.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7863" value="For ready kindness (shewn) to the saints is piety (shewn) to Christ, and ready kindness (shewn) towards those who belong to Christ, maketh him that sheweth it to be a minister of Christ. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7989" value="Not only if he hath many possessions, but also if he hath very few; whatsoever he hath this shall he offer."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8085" value=" And if a man shall give only a cup of cold water to a disciple, in the name of a disciple, Amen, I say unto you he shall not lose his reward."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8198" value="He will give unto thee, O rich man, the occasion for true liberty."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8255" value="For through these things thou shalt find thyself to be a fellow-worker with God. Thou shalt feed with the soldiers of Christ, and thou shalt feed with them at thy will, and thou shalt be constrained in no wise;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8387" value="For the King of heaven neither setteth restraint nor maketh demands upon the perfect. He receiveth to Himself those who give willingly, in order that those who give may also receive, and that those who pay honour may themselves be honoured,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8531" value=" and that those who make themselves partners with the poor in the things which are temporal shall be invited to take their share with them in the things which are forever."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8606" value="These things, let us remember, are forever and for all time. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8654" value="And let them be before our eyes, (and) they shall be in our souls, in order that we may make use of the time (or, opportunity), and not allow it to escape from us. And we must not forget the things which are. Now let us await after them that which is to come, lest through our expectation we thrust the matter behind us, and there come upon us our end. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8898" value="Now the Lord gave this unto us that we might find ourselves keeping watch. And we must produce fruit, and labour in the remembrance of His commandments; and we must make ourselves ready for His glorious rest, and then nothing whatsoever shall give us offense; "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9056" value="Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, to Whom be the glory, and with Him the Father, and the Holy Spirit, for all ages of ages. Amen."/>
