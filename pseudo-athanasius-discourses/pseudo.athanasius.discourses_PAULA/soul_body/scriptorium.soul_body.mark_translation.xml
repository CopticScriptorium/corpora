		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8" value="THE DISCOURSE WHICH THE HOLY PATRIARCH, APA ATHANASIUS, ARCHBISHOP OF RAKOTE, PRONOUNCED CONCERNING THE SOUL AND THE BODY."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan138" value="Now the word which hath been sent from heaven hath no ill-will (or, grudging) therein, and it is ready to cleanse that which is in the soul, provided that ye yourselves be prepared for the strength of the word, which, however, hath also need of him that listeneth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan303" value="For it is like the rain from heaven, which doth not produce fruit without the earth, neither doth the earth make things to grow without the rain from heaven."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan396" value="The meaning of which is, that the disciple gaineth no advantage without a master to teach him, neither doth the master without a pupil to listen to him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan488" value="The Logos giveth the speech ; let obedience (or, listening) of those who hearken to it make it perfect."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan564" value="For behold the Logos giveth its strength, (provided that) ye yourselves are without ill-will (or, grudging), and that ye first of all purify yourselves from every restraining influence and (from) ill-will (or, envy), and from unbelief, which are the enemies of righteousness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan711" value="Now envy warreth against love, and unbelief against belief, even as bitterness warreth against sweetness, and darkness against light, and that which is evil against that which is good; and death warreth against life, and falsehood against truth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan908" value="Now those who are full of the strength of that which is adverse to good, and have in them envy, and ill-will, and unbelief, hate love and faith (or, belief), and those who hate these things are the enemies of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1077" value="For we know, O my beloved, that all those who are filled with envy, and ill-will, and unbelief, are the enemies of righteousness; take good heed to yourselves, therefore, that ye may not become the enemies of righteousness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1212" value="Take unto yourselves belief and love, for through these salvation hath come unto all the saints, from the beginning even until this present."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1312" value="Moreover, make ye manifest the power of love, not only in word, but also in deed; now God hath given salvation for all of us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1424" value="For we ourselves did not come into being as the I whole world came into being, by the word of His mouth only, but He made us both by word and by deed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1542" value="God was not content with making Himself to say, 'Let us make man according to Our likeness and image,' but He made the action follow the word."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1654" value="For God took a piece of earth from the earth, and fashioned man, according to His own image and likeness, and He breathed into his face the breath of life."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1793" value="Now when Adam was nigh unto death because of his transgression, the material body of Adam needed to be fashioned a second time by the hand of God, the Fabricator, in order that he might receive salvation."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1944" value="Now (the body of) man rotteth away, and is buried in the earth, but the soul, which God breathed into him when he became a living soul, separateth itself from him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2075" value="And further, when (the body) is dead they carry off the soul into a place of darkness, into the region which is called 'Amente '."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2166" value="For the soul and the body become separated, and death divideth them each from the other."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2234" value="Now the soul is fettered in Amente, but the body (or, flesh) dissolveth in the earth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2315" value="And there is a very great gulf (fixed) between them—the flesh and the soul."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2378" value="Now the flesh disappeareth, and is diffused abroad in the earth wherein it hath been buried, but the soul is powerless in the bonds of Amente."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2498" value="The soul, which is a strong thing, is fettered in the darkness,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2536" value="but the body, which is a weak thing, dissolveth in the earth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2584" value="Now the body is not strong (enough) to move, (and) it dissolveth in the (funerary) mountain; neither is the soul able to do anything, (for) it is fettered in Amente."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2693" value="For when death beareth away a man, the strong portion (of him), which is the soul, it fettereth in Amente, and the weak portion (of him), which is the flesh, it carrieth off (into the earth.)"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2824" value="Now it is like a general who captureth the city of a king; when he hath taken possession thereof he first of all seizeth the king and shutteth him up under restraint."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2930" value="And this is what death doeth first of all to the soul. Now the body is like unto a ship which hath no steersman upon it, that is to say, the body perisheth, and it falleth to pieces, limb from limb, because the soul hath ceased to steer it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3121" value="And the members thereof are dissipated in the (funerary) mountain, and they perish like the city which hath been laid waste, and like the ship which hath no steersman in it, and hath become submerged in the waters."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3256" value="For it is the soul itself which steereth its body, even as the king administereth his city."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3339" value="Now when the man is dead, his soul is not able to steer his flesh, because it is fettered in Amente, and it drifteth about among the waves of (un)righteousness, even as a steersman whose ship drifteth about on the sea."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3492" value="And the soul heeleth over into the waves which are ready for it, and it is driven on into the breakers of the thieves that engulf it, that is to say, adultery, and fornication, and the love of ornament, and the worship of idols, and the slaying of men, and hatred;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3690" value="now these are the things whereby man slayeth the soul."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3741" value="And because of these things, whereby (the Evil One) hath seduced the soul, it is given over to the Evil One to whom it hath clung closely, and it is carried away into Amente;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3852" value="for he carrieth it off like a thief."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3899" value="Moreover, he maketh it to be without the power to assist its own body which perisheth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3975" value="The flesh dissolveth | in the earth, the substance (?) thereof decayeth, and one member droppeth away from the other because the soul is not in the body to bind them together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4102" value="And the soul itself is bound in Amente, having fetters not on the feet only, but on its whole person."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4166" value="For this reason it hath not the power to give help to its own body, and to prevent it from decaying in the earth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4242" value="Now it is like a captain who dieth when his ship foundereth,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4307" value=" that is to say, if the soul were not bound in Amente, it would be able to steer its own body, and would not allow it to perish."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4406" value="Moreover, the soul is bound (in Amente) not only with fetters, but it is bound with its own sins as with cords, and for this reason it hath become powerless, and it forsaketh its body, leaving it to perish in the earth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4565" value="And besides, the soul is made to suffer tortures in Amente. It becometh the footstool of death, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4641" value="and when it is in Amente it is wont to weep and sigh after its good body, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4710" value="Where is my body, that body wherein I used to sing hymns?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4773" value="Where is my body, that body wherein I used to pray to God?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4823" value="Where is my good body, that body wherein, when I was a man, I used to walk about with my friends and my kinsfolk?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4919" value="And I made merry in my body, I was called (by my name) whilst I was in my human body, and now I am no longer a man, but a soul."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5032" value="Now when death hath separated the soul from the body they call the body a 'corpse', and it giveth forth foetidness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5120" value="I enquire after my body, (but) I do not enquire after my name, that body together with which I was a man and in which I spake."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5220" value="And when the soul ceaseth to be in its body, the body can never again speak with a pleasing voice, but with a choked and exceedingly sad voice ;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5333" value="and it is like unto a musical instrument which hath no sound in it and is speechless."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5394" value="That is to say, the soul is not in the body to give utterance therefrom."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5468" value="And the body perisheth in the earth like a broken pot, and it becometh speechless, and it hath neither sound nor voice; and it is motionless, for it is a corpse,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5600" value="for the soul which adorned it hath departed, taking with it the power of speech."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5676" value="And it is impossible, moreover, to know what any man who is dead was like, for his form is destroyed by the sand."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5758" value="And thou canst know neither (what) his face (was like), nor the form of his person, nor the height of his stature, nor canst thou tell what the sound of his voice was like."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5856" value="For the son cannot know his own father, or his mother, or his brother, or his friend; it is wholly impossible (for him) to recognize the face of any one (of them) in the tomb."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5973" value="The lips have rotted away, the nose hath decayed, the eyes are blocked up, the colour of the face hath changed, and it is impossible to recognize any one of them ; because all bodies turn into dust in the tomb, and they perish, and nothing of them remaineth to us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6174" value="Now it is impossible to identify a bone, and to make it to rejoin the body to which it belonged, because the bone hath become bare, and there is no flesh on it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6289" value="And besides this, even before the flesh which clothed the bone crumbled away it would have been impossible for thee to shew clearly to whom it belonged."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6375" value="For who can identify a bone when it hath been taken out of the member (to which it belonged)?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6423" value="Or who is there that can make known to us the colour (of the hair) of one who is dead?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6476" value="And it is wholly impossible for thee to recognize the bones of Adam, or (to say) what manner of men the Prophets were, and what kind of bodies had the Patriarchs and the Apostles."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6598" value="They have all been cast in the earth, and their heads and their bodies have become separated."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6658" value="If the son were to seek after his father in the tomb, he would not recognize him, neither would a friend recognize his friend, nor a brother recognize his brother;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6754" value="nor could a man address any one of them by name, being sure that he really was the person who bore that name, or identify his form, because they have all turned to dust in the tomb, and there is no longer any human resemblance in them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6897" value="For man is scattered abroad over the face of all the earth, and he is poured out in every place, for the earth beareth a grievous burden of tombs and sepulchres, and every place is filled with"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7059" value="Moreover, the earth hath become one (great) sepulchre for those who are dead."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7110" value="It was one man only (i. e., Adam) who was taken from the earth, but those who are buried in it are thousands of thousands, and tens of thousands of tens of thousands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7208" value="Every place is filled with the dead, the sea and the rivers, the earth and the mountains, and the wild beasts and the birds of prey devour the dead, and are sated with their slaughtered bodies."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7337" value="And Amente is filled with the souls which are bound in fetters."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7385" value="O thou form of earth wherein grief is abundant! O thou form of man which groweth (only) for destruction, and flourisheth only in sorrows and sighings!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7505" value="The joy of those who are upon the earth is only for a moment, and yet they are wont to think that it is great; but it slippeth away speedily through their hands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7616" value="Behold, one man rejoiceth, and taketh a woman to wife, and soon after he weepeth for her, for she is dead!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7687" value="Behold, one man rejoiceth in his son, and behold, soon after he weepeth over his grave!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7754" value="Behold, another man exulteth because of his father, and (soon) afterwards he maketh lamentation and burieth him!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7816" value="For there is no profit whatsoever for man; he is one who (is intended to) lament, and there is no consolation in him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7885" value="He hath not the power to pacify him that shall destroy (him), neither doth he receive him that could console him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7954" value="Each man, in his own way, must die for himself, and no friend can make an appeal for his friend; but each man must suffer the death to which he is liable."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8054" value="There is no prophet of God who can give men consolation, for they will not hearken unto him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8123" value="Neither will they really believe in the God of heaven, nor will they do His Will until they fall into death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8214" value="Moreover, God is wroth with man because of his unutterable and indescribable transgressions, which destroy him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8304" value="For man suffereth evil in every way because of his transgressions, (namely) by sickness, by punishment, by sorrow, by the grief and suffering which envelop him, by cold and heat, by burning, by wild beasts, and birds of prey, and reptiles, by the times in which he liveth, and by old age."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8495" value="The winds, and the earthquakes, and the rains, and the dews, do harm to man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8549" value="The rivers drown him, the wild beasts devour him, and he is destroyed by death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8670" value="All (these things) have held him in contempt since he was disobedient to God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8720" value="And having been driven forth from the Paradise he came out into this world which is full of sufferings."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8790" value="In it are envy, and adultery, and fornication, and idolatry: and these are the things through which man dieth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8895" value="All these things have become fellow-workers with death in respect of man, and they war against him with wickednesses in order that death may bring him to the dust."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9002" value="For man hath at no time any enjoyment, never hath he any pleasure."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9058" value="For when during his lifetime doth man rejoice?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9108" value="Doth he rejoice when he is in the womb of his mother?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9150" value="What kind of enjoyment can he have when he is carried about in the darkness and foetor thereof, and when he is in pain and restraint on every side in the blood of the belly?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9259" value="But he must come forth from his mother's body: doth he rejoice (in doing this)?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9301" value="Nay, for he runneth an exceedingly great risk of dying."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9338" value="But surely he rejoiceth when he is at his mother's breast?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9374" value="Now in what manner doth he take the nipple? He crieth loudly and weepeth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9440" value="Now the child that is healthy neither crieth out nor weepeth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9489" value="But surely when man is a little child, he crawleth about on the ground and rejoiceth?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9549" value="In what way then doth he rejoice? He is liable to be attacked by some beast, which will trample him to death, and will split open his head, and the foam of his mouth and his intestines will be scattered about on the herbage (?) and on the ground."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9685" value="But surely if he groweth up into a young man he will rejoice?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9717" value="In what way, then, will he rejoice?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9747" value="(I say) he cannot rejoice;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9769" value="for the disposition of youth surroundeth him on every side with the lusts which are full of danger, and if he doth not crush them they cause him to die in an evil manner."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9896" value="But surely when he hath taken a wife, and hath begotten children, he will rejoice?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9940" value="In what way, then, will he rejoice? He will live in a state of anxiety about the children who will commit acts of folly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10008" value="But surely when he shall have become an old man (he will rejoice, and take rest)? In what way, then, will he have rest?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10051" value="He will rest with the dangers of old age (always) round about him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10098" value="And at the end of all these (troubles) is the expectation of death, which consumeth the soul like a fire."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10188" value="O thou death, thou carriest off (people) of every age and condition—the children and the old man, the youth and the man of mature growth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10270" value="For age (or, stature) is no obstacle to death, and he carrieth away (people) of every age and condition."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10381" value="Now it is an exceedingly sorrowful thing to look upon death in man, and to contemplate his decay."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10446" value="The face hath become ghastly pallid in the garb of death, and the body hath become shrivelled up, and the mouth is shut up, and the hair hath become lustreless (?), and the eyes have become sightless and are shut, and the limbs are motionless."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10615" value="And as for the other changes which take place in the body when it is placed in the earth, the flesh crumbleth away, and the sinews and ligaments decay, and the other (members) which have been laid bare, (and) those which have not been laid bare, become dissolved, and the humours which have dried up, and the dust which is abundant."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10794" value="For man is a thing of nought, and he is like unto a flower of the grasses which withereth, and he shrivelleth up like a log of wood which is burned in the fire and is consumed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10929" value="Now after the destruction of man, and (seeing) his wretchedness, which was very great,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10977" value=" God visited that which He Himself had fashioned, and had made in His own form and likeness, in order that Death might not become the conqueror."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11095" value="Death boasted himself saying, ' I will conquer man.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11135" value="Now the Devil fighteth against man at all times, and he carrieth him away captive through the evil of death into the gate of Amente."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11248" value="And he hurleth his wickedness against man at all times, until at length he bringeth him under the power of death, and he shutteth him up in the prison of Amente."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11364" value="For this reason the soul which is fast bound in darkness is not able to make its escape from the place of imprisonment of those who are dead."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11451" value="For this reason the Father sent His Son upon the earth. Now He had no body of flesh; therefore the Holy Spirit"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11535" value="caused Him to take upon Himself flesh in the womb of the Virgin. And God became man so that He might deliver him that had gone astray, and might gather together those who were scattered through the envy of the Devil, and might bring them into His fold."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11712" value="Death having made a separation in man, those whom Death had scattered, these did Christ gather together, and He hath made man one again, the soul with the body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11841" value="For Death bound the soul in Amente, and he made the flesh to dissolve in the earth; thus he divided man into two parts."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11930" value="The Saviour Jesus, however, Himself set free the soul from its bonds, and He bound the flesh together inseparably,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12022" value="and He brought the two towards each other, and made them one of one, the soul and the body, and He rejoined them each to the other."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12125" value="He gave the body to the soul, and the soul He placed in the body;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12182" value="He made (the body) to be an instrument of speech, and He gave it constituted members."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12251" value="And now, O soul, sing thou hymns of praise in the body wherein thou art, to thine own Imperishable God, because Christ died for us, in order that we might live with Him for ever."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12409" value="For He was neither liable to Death, nor was He under any obligation to die by Death;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12458" value="neither was it absolutely necessary for Him to make Himself to become man,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12501" value="nor had He Himself any need to take upon Himself the flesh of man:"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12536" value="for He is God, and He is arrayed in all the glory of Divinity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12592" value="For this reason he endured patiently and was made after the manner of men who die, (though) He is the God Who alone dieth not."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12676" value="Now for what reason did He come down upon the earth, seeing that He Himself was the King, Who was reigning over the heavens?"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12833" value="Though He Himself was the Fabricator of the universe, He endured patiently, and allowed Himself to be begotten in the womb of a woman. And they wrapped in swaddling bands "/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12968" value="He Who sat on the I chariots of the Cherubim was laid in a manger, and He sucked the nipple at the breast of a woman."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13115" value="He Who sent forth waters to flow in the rivers, and the rains, and the dews, and Who sent forth waters from heaven, received baptism in the Jordan by a mortal man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13262" value="He from Whom the whole universe receiveth light was treated with contempt by the Jews."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13319" value="He upon Whose Word hang the seven heavens, and the firmament, and the earth, and Amente, was Himself hung upon a Cross of wood."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13409" value="He Who took a clod of dead earth, and fashioned it into a living man, bare patiently the scorn of those who mocked Him, in order that by the contempt of Himself He might save man, who had gone to perdition through his own sins."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13560" value="He gave His soul of salvation for the soul of man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13607" value="He gave His holy flesh on behalf of the whole race of Adam. And He gave His Blood on behalf of all."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13693" value="He gave Man for man, and His death for our death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13748" value="And the death which men are under an obligation to suffer, and which they fear, became a blessing, because Christ died for us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13854" value="This is the love which Christ made manifest. He died for us, who. are sinners, in order that He might save us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13944" value="For what righteous man ever died on behalf of a sinner?"/>
