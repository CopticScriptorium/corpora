		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="The page numbers in the manuscript contain errors, skipping pages 32 and 34. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM's edition includes only Budge's transcription of the manuscript. It is not a diplomatic transcription based on reading and collation of the original manuscript. The translation is Budge's with very slight modifications (e.g., numbers mistranslated.) Chapters are based on ekthesis in Budge's edition. The pb xml ids correspond to numbered pages in the ms as provided by Budge; if Budgeâ€™s edition omits the number we have extrapolated based on the provided page number; Budge notes on p XV of his edition that the pagination in this codex is sometimes irregular. Budge's title for the work is: &amp;quot;The Discourse which Saint Athanasius, Archbishop of Rakote, pronounced concerning the passage in the Gospel of Saint Matthew, 'The kingdom which is in the heavens is like unto a rich man who came out in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard.'&amp;quot;"/></featList></paula>
