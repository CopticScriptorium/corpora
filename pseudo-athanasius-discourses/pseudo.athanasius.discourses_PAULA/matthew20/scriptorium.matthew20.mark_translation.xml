		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4148" value="The stater which He gave unto them was the honour of Apostleship, and the Holy Offering."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4216" value="And, the Scripture saith, when they had taken the stater, they murmured against the lord of the vineyard and said, Why is it?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4281" value="These last have only laboured for one hour, and yet thou hast paid them the same amount as thou hast paid to us.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4342" value="Now, who are these who murmured and were envious of the labourers who came in last except the scribes and the Pharisees, who had themselves been sent to labour in the vineyard?"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4570" value="For they themselves received the Law as the commands of angels, but they did not keep it, and they murmured against the Lord saying, 'The disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Thy disciples do not fast."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4744" value="Why do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4789" value="They wash not their hands when they eat their bread, they eat, they drink, they make merry."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4858" value="Even the Apostles cut down the ears of corn and eat before Thy very face, and they wander about at large in the world.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4920" value="It was these very men that murmured saying, 'Why have Thy disciples made the Sabbath to be of none effect?' who were envious of these last who were the labourers in truth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5014" value="And the lord (of the vineyard) made answer, and said unto one of them, 'Friend, I have done thee no injustice."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5078" value="Did I not agree with thee for one stater? Take what is thine and depart.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5150" value="And who was it who made all these complaints?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5195" value="I say that it was none other than he unto whom it was said, 'Friend, that wherefor thou hast come, do,' that is to say, it was Judas, who betrayed the Saviour, and who spake with great murmurings saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5347" value="Why did they not sell the unguent for three hundred staters and give them to the poor?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5419" value="If thou didst care for the poor, O betrayer, why didst thou steal their property from the coffer of the treasury?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5488" value="Or was thine eye evil because I am good?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5541" value="Now because he was a wicked man he stole the money which was cast into it (i.e., the coffer)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5599" value="And the Saviour Himself was good to him, and He shewed Himself longsuffering in respect of him, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5666" value="for He said unto him, 'I have not the power to do that which I wish with the offerings which they bring.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5738" value="This was God's defence of him : 'I, Who am God, have not the power to pay more wages than those which a man shall earn, and I judge those who shall work wickedness'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5868" value="These are the testimonies, and the murmurings of Judas; he murmured with his tongue,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5942" value=" and he was cruel and merciless in his heart."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5981" value="He was a wicked man in his soul, he was a thief with his hands, and he was shameless in respect of his eyes."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6063" value="And when they were eating, the Apostles watched that they might not let their hands touch those of the Saviour in the bowl, for they were afraid, and said, Who are we that we should eat with God?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6210" value="But Judas, the man with no right perception, did not hesitate to put his hand into the bowl with the Saviour, and he was eager to dip his piece of bread at the same time, and to eat before the Saviour. The Saviour said nothing in order that we might understand."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6381" value="When the disciples had asked Him, 'Who, then, is it that shall betray Thee?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6433" value="He gave them a sign of the want of right perception in Judas saying, 'He who shall dip his hand with Me into the bowl first is he who shall betray Me'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6545" value="and He said unto him, 'That which thou shalt do, do quickly'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6596" value="For the Saviour made haste to work out the salvation of His creation on the Cross, according to the wish and I commandment of His Father."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6696" value="Thou wilt not find that He put out of the way, or was careless about that for which He had come, or that He was afraid of death;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6795" value="but He made manifest His readiness for the Cross like a valiant martyr, and like God Who is without fear."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6891" value="Therefore did He urge Judas onward saying, 'That which thou shalt do, do quickly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6956" value="Haste thee onward, for all these created beings are hindered; they await thee, and moreover, they await Me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7052" value="Those beings who are in the heavens await Me, and those beings who are in the abyss and chaos await thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7115" value="My Father is with Me, and He will help Me; the Devil is with thee, and he standeth by thy side, on the right hand of thee, and he will help thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7225" value="Those who are in the gates which are in the heavens, that is, the holy angels, will crown Me, and the avenging powers are making Amente ready for thee"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7321" value="And He urged him onward with these words, 'Haste thee, for I am ready for the whips (or, scourgings).'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7395" value="Rightly therefore did Esdras say, 'The creature may not haste more than the Creator.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7473" value="Now since Judas was he who should betray Him, why did He cry out to him, 'Friend, I do thee no injustice'?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7567" value="Though He said to him, 'Thine eye is evil, but I Myself am good"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7633" value=" the Saviour did not withhold the speech of friendship from him until the hour in which he betrayed Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7709" value="He called him 'friend', but He thought of enmity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7771" value="He gave him the bag that held the money, and he became a thief."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7822" value="He chose him as a disciple, but he meditated guile. He chose him as a man, but he became a devil."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7926" value="O Judas, what is it thou didst do? And what didst thou gain when thou didst betray the Lord?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8009" value="Thou didst waste thy life, and didst lose this great honour, the glory of Apostleship."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8086" value="For who is above his lot? After the appellation of 'Angel' cometh the title of 'Apostle.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8158" value="Now a man hardly considereth his son to be worthy to eat with him, yet it was a helpless servant who was made to eat with his God,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8254" value="and Jesus, our Lord, considered him to be worthy to do so. He ate with the tax-gatherers, and He drank with Judas the lawless man, and a pestilent man reached out his hand with (that of) God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8382" value="This wretched man lost his life, and accepted death for himself; he exalted himself above his worth, and he fell down on to the ground according to his worth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8503" value="Jesus chose him with the Apostles, and he lost his Apostleship."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8548" value="He was chosen to be an heir, and he himself abandoned Thine inheritance."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8599" value="Now the Apostles were the heirs of the Saviour, and they were the light of the world, but Judas did not wish to give forth light."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8695" value="They were the salt of the earth, but Judas did not wish to purge away what was polluted."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8746" value="They were those whom God set in the Church, but Judas did not wish to continue with them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8818" value="Therefore was he removed from the measure of manhood, and he became the portion of the Devil."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8894" value="Woe be unto thee, O Judas! In what didst thou benefit thyself? Better Cain, who killed a man, than Judas, who killed God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8981" value="Better Saul, who hated a man, than Judas, who hated God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9024" value="Better the hardheartedness of Pharaoh towards the people than the hardheartedness of Judas towards God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9086" value="Better the deceit of Balaam than the wickedness of Judas."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9127" value="Better the rebellious speech of Korah in the desert than the stiffnecked ness of Judas in Jerusalem."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9195" value="Better Achar (Achan), who stole the accursed thing, than Judas who stole the gifts of charity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9257" value="Better the arrogance of Absalom in respect of David than the contumacy of Judas in respect of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9313" value="Better the evil counsel to David of Ahitophel, who hanged himself and died, than the condemnation of Judas, who hanged himself and is in Tartaros, against the Saviour."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9436" value="Better, by far, the cursings by Shimei of David than the scorn of the Saviour by Judas."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9497" value="Of far less evil was the bloody murder by Joab, which he committed in sheer wickedness, than the murder by Judas, which he committed in pitilessness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9592" value="Better the love of money by Gehazi, who became a leper, than the avaviciousness of Judas who went to destruction."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9648" value="The sin of Jeroboam was less than the wickedness of Judas, for Jeroboam (only) made false gods, but Judas rejected the True God."/>
