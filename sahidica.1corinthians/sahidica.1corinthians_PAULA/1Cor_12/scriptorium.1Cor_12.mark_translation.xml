		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan56" value="You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan167" value="Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God&amp;apos;s Spirit says, &amp;apos;Jesus is accursed.&amp;apos; No one can say, &amp;apos;Jesus is Lord,&amp;apos; but by the Holy Spirit."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan843" value="But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan942" value="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ."/>
