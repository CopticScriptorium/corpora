		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7" value="Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan112" value="But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn&amp;apos;t yet know as he ought to know."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan174" value="But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan233" value="Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan324" value="For though there are things that are called &amp;apos;gods,&amp;apos; whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many &amp;apos;gods&amp;apos; and many &amp;apos;lords;&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan439" value="yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan594" value="However, that knowledge isn&amp;apos;t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan719" value="But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don&amp;apos;t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan822" value="But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan879" value="For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol&amp;apos;s temple, won&amp;apos;t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1017" value="And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1091" value="Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1184" value="Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don&amp;apos;t cause my brother to stumble."/></featList></paula>
