		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9" value="When I came to you, brothers, I didn&amp;apos;t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan124" value="For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan205" value="I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan283" value="My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan383" value="that your faith wouldn&amp;apos;t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan452" value="We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan572" value="But we speak God&amp;apos;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan681" value="which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn&amp;apos;t have crucified the Lord of glory."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan784" value="But as it is written, &amp;apos;Things which an eye didn&amp;apos;t see, and an ear didn&amp;apos;t hear, which didn&amp;apos;t enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan926" value="But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1025" value="For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God&amp;apos;s Spirit."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1156" value="But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1394" value="Now the natural man doesn&amp;apos;t receive the things of God&amp;apos;s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can&amp;apos;t know them, because they are spiritually discerned."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1528" value="But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1604" value="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?&amp;apos; But we have Christ&amp;apos;s mind."/></featList></paula>
