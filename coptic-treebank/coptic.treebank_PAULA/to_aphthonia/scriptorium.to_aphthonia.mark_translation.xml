		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7" value="You have given glory to God indeed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan41" value="It’s to you that I speak, you Aphthonia, daughter of the Comes Alexander."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan100" value="Have you not honoured the place you were nourished in according to God and according to the world , in your words and your deeds?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan195" value="If your heart hadn’t corrupted, you would not despise the place you are in, or shame the sisters who are in the place with you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan296" value="They call you by your name “Aphthonia”, but you revile yourself alone."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan369" value="And you are a slanderer to you yourself, what you wish is to destroy your soul, which the whole world isn’t worthy of."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan467" value="and to lead astray in your sufferings for no reason."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan503" value="For you have left room for Satan inside you to transform your heart, and daze you like those sheep that become (spoiled) by moths."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan623" value="You stupid and foolish one in which there isn’t wisdom."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan669" value="For if there had been knowledge in you, even if they truly fought with you, then you ought to let a man know how they are inside your place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan785" value="Most of all when you sent to your father and your mother: “they fought with me,” or “they abused me”."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan877" value="It’s you lying, as they didn’t fight with you nor did they abuse you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan928" value="That they “fought with you” was that you were given knowledge in your transgressing the law by your receiving something from your parents without asking."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1045" value="What is it that you asked for or needed and were rejected, or you weren’t given it?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1134" value="If you told your father and your mother, are we to be afraid?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1189" value="All the more so as you lie."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1210" value="So you don’t want us to tell them about your foolish actions which you do and your stealing and your quarrels."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1305" value="Oh you truly blind one who gropes in daylight like those who are in midnight and like those blind ones, who have no eyes."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1423" value="Where is it that your parents from the world will hear of your action inside this place, without us knowing in the monastery?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1529" value="So if they truly did violence to you or grieved or pained you, you should have told us of your pain."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1631" value="I tell you we’ll know if it’s the truth you’re telling or not."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1671" value="Or you should have told your mother in this place with you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1713" value="If you don’t call her only with your mouth “mother”."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1764" value="But it’s that your heart is distant far away from her."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1803" value="As it is written:"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1820" value="“this people honours me with their lips, but their heart is distant far away from me.”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1895" value="For if your stupid heart hadn’t darkened on you, would you have scorned your parents who are in the community with you,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1993" value="or despised the sisters that you dwell with in your pride and your boastfulness?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2072" value="Or if you hadn’t left behind you the teaching and the wisdom."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2123" value="And as you loved what is evil, instead of what is good."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2171" value="Would you have practiced things which are evil, and said with your mouth that is full of curses upon bitterness:"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2257" value="“I’ll go to another monastery”."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2285" value="In what was it that this place did you violence?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2327" value="Or what is the weight that they put on you,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2375" value="except that they told you “don’t violate the command of God,”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2437" value="because you gave perfume and mesouaphi to a maiden while she was in the house with you"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2500" value="so that you’ll become an obstacle and a scandal to each other."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2553" value="For this thing, I promise you that if you don’t give your admission and take away this disobedience of yours and those quarrels in vain,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2663" value="I will make your heart suffer."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2689" value="And I will make them treat you like what came out of you mouth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2756" value="Indeed I am concerned, for you (Aphthonia) and for you (the congregation)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2817" value="What I&amp;apos;m afraid of is that, in the way that the serpent deceived Eve in his treachery, your hearts waste away from the simplicity and the purity which bring to Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2962" value="If he didn&amp;apos;t leave the one who is there in paradise, is it you (Aphthonia) that he will spare?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3028" value="Or you (the congregation), in your leaving room for him inside yourselves."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3075" value="As you also indulge in his plans of guile and his wicked deeds."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3136" value="For he will not have power over those who fear God inside. Those for whom Christ is an aid and a protector."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3250" value="As it is written: &amp;apos;the one who fights on your behalf is your aid, and the sword of your pride and the glory of your foundation&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3360" value="Whoever will love that which is evil, he is the one who will perish."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3411" value="And he is the one that the devil will have power over in his deeds of soul killing."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3485" value="But the wise one who loves the teaching, he will receive the commandment."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3558" value="And the intelligent one who fears God inside will acquire guidance for himself."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3635" value="But let me hear that you have pleased your parents who are in the place with you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3699" value="And that you obey them in every action."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3738" value="And our heart shall be at ease."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3758" value="And as for you, you will be filled with satisfaction."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3808" value="But if you still have something to say, here are the elders, our parents and our brothers, they have come to you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3914" value="Proclaim it to them, and all of you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3954" value="So you have words there, or any deed in your place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4011" value="Don&amp;apos;t continue to want to tell them"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4035" value="As you do not hide anything from them"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4069" value="So that all our hearts may be at ease together, we and you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4125" value="And God will be pleased with us too."/></featList></paula>
