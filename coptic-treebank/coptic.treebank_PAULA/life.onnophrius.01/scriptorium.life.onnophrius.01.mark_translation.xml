		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6" value="THE LIFE AND CONVERSATION OF OUR HOLY FATHER, WHO WAS GLORIOUS IN EVERY WAY, APA ONNOPHRIOS THE ANCHORITE, WHO ENDED HIS LIFE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH PAONE IN THE PEACE OF GOD!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan154" value="BLESS US! AMEN."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan182" value="A CERTAIN brother who was an anchorite, and whose name was Apa Pa[p]noute, made a discourse to the God-loving brethren,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan256" value="and these were the words which he addressed to them. I, [your] brother, was thinking one day, and I determined to go into the inner desert, so that I might see if there were any brethren who were monks living in the most remote parts of it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan402" value="I marched four days and four nights, and I neither ate bread nor drank water. I marched on into the inner desert,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan507" value="and at the end of a [further number] of days I came upon a cave."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan562" value="And when I had drawn nigh thereto I knocked at the door at midday, and no one answered me,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan666" value="and I thought in my mind 'there is no brother in this place'."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan713" value="And I saw a brother seated inside it, and he was silent,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan780" value="and I took hold of his arm, and his arm came off in my hands, and became particles of dust;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan875" value="and I felt his body all over, and I found that he was dead, and that the skin had perished (?)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan955" value="And I looked and I saw a short-sleeved shirt hanging up inside the cave,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1015" value="and when I felt it with my hands, it also fell to pieces and became dust."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1066" value="And I stood up, and I prayed, and I took my garment"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1126" value="and wrapped the body up in it, and I dug a hole in the earth with my hands, and I buried him [in it]. And I came forth from that place,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1231" value="and I marched on into the desert, and I came upon another cave, and my courage came to me, and I thrust open the door [and cried out], and no one answered me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1356" value="And I went in and I found no man, and I came forth, saying, 'The place of a servant of God; he will soon return to this place.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1480" value="And I remained in that place, and I prayed until the day ran to its close,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1546" value="and I recited the books which I had learned by heart."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1579" value="And afterwards, just as the sun was about to set, I looked up and I saw a herd of buffaloes in the far distance coming towards me, and that brother was among them,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1692" value="and when he approached me he was naked, and his hair covered his shame, and it served as raiment to clothe him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1806" value="And when he had come to the place where I was he was exceedingly afraid, for he thought that I was a spirit, and he stood up and prayed,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1897" value="for very often spirits used to come to tempt him, according to what he himself subsequently said."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1972" value="And I perceived that he was afraid, and I went to him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2023" value="and I said unto him ' Wherefore art thou afraid, O servant of God?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2089" value="Look, and thou wilt see my footprints, and that I am a man. Touch me, and [thou wilt find] that I am flesh and blood.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2175" value="And when he had gazed upon me he repeated the prayer in the Gospel."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2239" value="And I urged him to take me into the cave."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2301" value="And he asked me 'Wherefore didst thou come to this place?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2356" value="And I said, 'I came to this place because I wished to see the servants of God who live in this desert, and God hath not denied me that which I asked of Him.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2499" value="And I asked him, saying, ' How didst thou come to this place? And how long ago is it since thou didst come here? And what dost thou usually eat? And why dost thou go naked and wear no € clothing on thy body?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2665" value="And he began to talk with me, saying, 'I was a monk, and I lived among a congregation of monks in Thebais."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2784" value="And there came into my heart a thought of this kind: Rise up, go forth, and abide in a place by thyself. And thou shalt lead a life of peaceful contemplation. Thou shalt become an anchorite, and shalt receive the brethren. Thou shalt shew abundant hospitality to strangers, and thou shalt find abundant wages by the work of thy hands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3002" value="And that which I thought in my mind I carried into effect."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3041" value="I came away from the house of the monks, I built myself a habitation in a place apart, and I took up my abode therein."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3135" value="And men employed me, and what they gave me for the work of my hands I used to give away in charity to strangers."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3215" value="At that time the Devil became envious of me, because of the wages which I was earning before the Lord in respect of what I did for strangers and for other folk who were in want; for he saw how diligent I was in manual labour,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3402" value="and he was exceedingly jealous of me. And he entered into a certain woman who was a nun, and who came to me, and employed me to do certain hand work,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3533" value="and when I had finished it I gave it to her,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3578" value="and she talked to me about further work. And it became a customary thing for us to meet each other, and the Enemy put it into my heart to take work of the hands from her."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3721" value="And when we had learned to talk freely to each other we ate bread together,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3769" value="and the affair continued to grow until at last we brought forth death, and produced iniquity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3859" value="And when once I had fallen with her into folly we remained in this wicked state for six months."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3941" value="Afterwards I meditated in my heart upon what I had done, and I grieved, and wept exceedingly, and I was always heaving sighs."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4051" value="Afterwards I meditated in my heart upon what I had done, and I grieved, and wept exceedingly, and I was always heaving sighs."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4163" value="And I thought in my heart when I was alone, saying, ‘If I were to die to-day or to-morrow they would punish us with a severe punishment, with the gnashing of teeth, and with outer darkness, and with the fire that cannot be quenched, and with the worm that never sleepeth, and that devoureth the soul."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4370" value="Rise up, let us escape from this place,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4400" value="let us get away into the desert.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4421" value="And I wished to escape from the sin."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4471" value="And I rose up and came forth, and I departed into the desert,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4522" value="and I have never been with that woman since I have been here."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4573" value="And I found this spring- of water, and this palm tree, and this cave."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4622" value="This palm-tree yieldeth twelve bunches of dates each year, a bunch for each month,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4692" value="and one bunch of dates is sufficient to last me for the month."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4738" value="I possess nothing, neither raiment nor the food of bread."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4798" value="My hair increaseth, and as my clothes were worn out utterly long ago,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4856" value="I clothe myself, as is most seemly, with the raiment of my hair."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4911" value="And behold, it is thirty years since I came to this place, and the climate thereof bestoweth upon me health uniformly. And I never eat bread.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5033" value="And I asked him, 'At first when thou didst come to this place, didst thou suffer greatly?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5101" value="And he said unto me, 'Yea, I did suffer greatly, so much so in fact that sometimes through the intensity of my sorrow I used to throw myself on the ground, and cry up to God because of my manifold sins."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5301" value="And I also suffered great pain through an infirmity which was upon me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5359" value=" [One day] I looked and I saw a man who was exceedingly splendid standing by me,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5424" value="and he said unto me, “In what part of the body art thou ill?”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5460" value="And my strength returned unto me a little, and I said unto him, “I am ill in my liver.”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5547" value="And he said unto me, “Shew me the place wherein thou art ill,”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5601" value="and I shewed him the place where my liver was in pain."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5639" value="And he stretched out his hand upon me, and his fingers rested upon each other, and he made an opening between mⲩ ribs as with a sword (or, knife), and he brought forth my liver, and he shewed me the wounds that were in it,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5793" value="and he relieved the pains in them, and bound the wounds up, and he put my liver back into its place again."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5884" value="And he rubbed my body lightly with his hands, and he rejoined the sides of the opening which he had made in my side,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5964" value="and he said unto me, “Behold, thou art healed. Sin not again, lest evil more severe than this come upon thee. But make thyself a servant of God from this time for ever.”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6090" value="From that day all my bowels have remained in a healthy condition, and I have ceased to suffer in my liver,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6180" value="and I have lived in this place in the desert without pains."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6216" value="And he taught me what the medicament was wherewith he treated my liver.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6264" value="And I entreated him to let me stay in the cave wherein I had seen him at first,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6336" value="and he said unto me, 'Thy strength is not sufficient to enable thee to resist the attacks of the devils.' And I urged him to tell me his name,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6442" value="and he said unto me, Timothy is my name."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6484" value="Remember me, O my beloved brother, [in thy prayers], so that the Lord may make me to bring to an end the good fight whereto He hath summoned me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6579" value="And I cast myself down at his feet so that he might remember and bless me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6644" value="And he blessed me, saying,' The Lord bless thee! May He deliver thee from the snares of the Devil, and may He set thee on all His good paths at all times, and mayest thou escape to the saints.”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6821" value="And when he had finished blessing me my strength came to me to such a degree that I never felt when I was hungry or when I was thirsty."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6932" value="And when I perceived the great marvel that had come to me I rose up, and I journeyed into the mountain."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7018" value="And when four days had passed by I felt pain, and I stretched out my hands to heaven,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7090" value="and I prayed, and behold the man who had come unto me at first again came unto me,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7146" value="and he gave unto me strength as at the first."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7205" value="In short, when four days had passed I journeyed on into [the desert]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7254" value="And straightway I looked, and I saw a man in the distance, and he was an exceedingly terrifying object, for his hair was spread out over his body like that of a panther, and he was naked, and his privy parts were covered with leaves."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7456" value="And when he had come nigh unto me I was afraid,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7490" value="and I went up on a pinnacle of the mountain, [thinking that] perhaps he was a man in delirium."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7553" value="And when he had come he cast himself down for a little time under the shadow of the pinnacle of the mountain, and he was greatly distressed because of the pain which he was suffering, and he was in great danger of dying of hunger and thirst."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7702" value="And he lifted up his eyes to the pinnacle of the mountain, and when he saw me he cried out, saying. 'Come down to me, O thou holy man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7819" value="I also am a man of the mountain like unto thyself, and I am living in the desert because of my sins.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7894" value="And he said unto me, ' Thou art a friend (?) of God.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7956" value="And I sat down before him, and I conjured him to tell me his name."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8041" value="And he said unto me, 'Onnophrios is my name. And behold, I have lived in this desert for sixty years. I wander about in the mountains like the wild animals, and I never see any man who recognizeth me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8208" value="I lived at one time in a habitation of monks, in the mountain of Shmun of the Thebaid."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8269" value="And the name of that monastery was Erete."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8311" value="We all lived together, and each of us was of the same mind, and peace dwelt in our midst. We lived with each other a life of quiet contemplation, and we ascribed glory unto God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8439" value="And I passed nights in vigil with them, and I learned the rules of God from them; and their chief men were perfect even as the angels of the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8579" value="And I heard them speaking about our father Elijah, the Tishbite, and saying that he was wholly powerful in God while he lived in this desert ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8687" value="John the Baptist also, than whom of all those who have been born of women none hath arisen who is greater than he. He lived in the desert-places until the day of his manifestation before Israel."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8833" value="And I said unto them: My fathers, are not then those who are in the desert more excellent than we are?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8913" value="For behold, we see each other daily, and we partake of the Sacrament together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8987" value="When we are hungry we make use of the food which is prepared for us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9031" value="When we are thirsty we take water to drink."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9066" value="When we are weak our brethren reach out their hands to help us,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9108" value="and when we wish for the loan of a vessel to eat from we make use of those belonging to each other, for the love of God."/></featList></paula>
