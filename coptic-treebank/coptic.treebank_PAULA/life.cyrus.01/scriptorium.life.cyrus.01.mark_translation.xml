		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7" value="THE LIFE AND CONVERSATION OF OUR SAINTED FATHER, WHO WAS GLORIOUS IN EVERYTHING, SAINT APA CYRUS, THE PERFECT GOVERNOR, WHICH WAS W'RITTEN BY APA PAMBO, THE ELDER OF THE CHURCH OF SHIET. SAINT APA CYRUS DIED ON THE EIGHTH DAY OF THE MONTH EPEIPH IN THE PEACE OF GOD."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan248" value="MAY HIS HOLY BLESSING COME UPON US, AND MAY WE BE SAVED! AMEN."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan308" value="And it came to pass in the time of Apa Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet, after he had protected the body of the blessed woman Hillaria, the daughter of the Emperor Zeno,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan435" value="A vision was shewn to him, [and a voice said unto him,] 'Rise up, and go thou into the district which is on the sea-coast,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan509" value="and thou shalt enquire for the anchorite, of whose sandals there is not in the whole world anyone who is worthy to unloose the latchets.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan601" value="And the blessed Apa Pambo rose up and went into the desert in the strength of God which was with him, even as it was with the blessed Antonius at the time when he was on his journey to go to the blessed man Apa Paulus a second time."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan786" value="And the blessed elder Apa Pambo rose up and went into the desert,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan858" value="and he came to the cell of a monk,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan888" value="and he stood still and knocked at the door for a considerable space of time,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan942" value="and he cried out three times, according to the rules of the monkish brethren saying, 'Bless me!'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1031" value="And whilst I, Pambo, was standing at the door, the brother made answer to me inside, saying, ' Hail, Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet, thou mighty ship that sailest over the desert that is without water."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1203" value="Behold, I have eagerly desired to see thee for a very long time!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1246" value="Behold, God hath fulfilled for me my wish this day!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1302" value="Come in, O blessed man!'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1335" value="And Apa Pambo answered, saying, 'Hail thou, Apa Hierax, who hast become a companion of the angels of God by reason of thy purity.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1451" value="And Apa Hierax opened the door, and brought in Apa Pambo, and they sat down together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1539" value="And Apa Pambo said unto him, 'My beloved brother Apa Hierax, behold, is it very many years since thou didst come to this place?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1646" value="And Apa Hierax said unto Pambo, 'Behold, I have been in this place eighteen years, and I have never eaten any of the foods which are usually eaten in this world, but I have lived upon the fruit of trees.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1763" value="Now there was a palm-tree growing outside that cell, and it produced twelve clusters, one cluster each month,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1867" value="and he lived upon the fruit thereof."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1891" value="And I, Pambo, said unto him, 'My beloved father, are there any brethren living beyond thee in the desert?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1961" value="And Apa Hierax said, 'There are some;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1986" value="bless me, and get thee gone to them, and receive a blessing at their hands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2042" value="And having departed from him into the mountain I came to a small cell of a monk,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2111" value="and I called into it according to the rule of the monkish brethren."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2157" value="And as I stood outside it, the brother made answer unto me from the inside, saying, 'Hail, Apa Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet, thou mighty ship that sailest over the desert that is without water,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2346" value="behold, I have longed eagerly to see thee for many days."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2388" value="At last hath God fulfilled my wish for me this day;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2440" value="come inside, and do not stand outside.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2481" value="And I made answer to him, 'I am Pambo, O my beloved father Pamoun my lord!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2554" value="Hail, my beloved brother, unto whom belongeth the coat of many colours, which is like unto the coat of Joseph the righteous man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2634" value="And before God it is more precious than all the purple of the kings of this world.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2700" value="Believe me, O my brethren and fathers, I, Pambo, the least of all men, smelled the sweet odour of that brother for a mile before I came to the place where he was."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2814" value="And when we had saluted each other, we offered up prayer, and we sat down."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2857" value="And I said unto him, ' My father, I know that thou must be cold in winter, and thou wilt not be burnt up with the heat in the summer, when wearing a tunic of this kind.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2963" value="And Apa Pamoun said unto me, because this, most certainly, is its name, O my beloved brother Apa Pambo."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3068" value="Believe me, O my beloved father, behold, it is twenty years ago since I came to this place, and with this single garment I have found means to keep myself warm during the winter, and to moderate the heat of the atmosphere in summer time."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3235" value="And I confess unto thee that this tunic will suffice for me until the day of my death;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3298" value="and, moreover, when I am dead it will be large enough for them to roll me up in it until the day of the Judgement of Truth.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3381" value="And I said unto him, 'My beloved father, is there any brother living beyond thee in the desert?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3444" value="And he said unto me, 'There is one brother the latchet of one of whose sandals all the whole world is not worthy to unloose."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3541" value="I myself went to him many times, wishing to visit him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3593" value="and he used to answer me from the inside of his cell, saying, 'Get thee gone! In coming hither thou hast given thyself trouble [to no purpose]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3695" value="No man of flesh shall see my face, except the elder of the church of Shiet.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3778" value="And now, O my father, perhaps it was ordained for thee to take me with thee, so that I may receive a blessing at his hands before I die.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3896" value="And I said unto him, 'Nay, it is not ordained thus, and it is not for this purpose that I have come to this place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3997" value="But I will remember thee if the Lord maketh straight my way so that I may meet that brother."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4072" value="And, my father, do thou remember me until I shall enjoy the blessing of that brother.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4137" value="And when I had journeyed into the mountain about the distance of a mile — now I, Pambo, the least of men, swear unto thee by the awful throne of God, and I do not lie in what I am going to say — the being who seized the prophet Habakkuk in ancient days, and carried him, and the food which was in his hands, and brought him to the pit of the lions [when] Habakkuk gave it (i.e. the food) to Daniel who was in the pit of the lions,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4447" value="this same being, I say, seized me under the impulse of the Spirit, and brought me to the little habitation of that brother."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4543" value="And I knocked at the door, according to the rule of the monkish brethren, and I stood still at the door for a long time."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4642" value="And after these things the brother answered me from within, saying, 'Hail, Apa Pambo, thou elder of the church of Shiet, thou mighty ship that sailest over the desert that is without water."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4804" value="Behold, for very many days I have eagerly desired to see thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4846" value="Behold, this day hath God fulfilled my desire."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4898" value="Come in, and stand not outside.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4939" value="And when I was passing in through the door of the little habitation I looked, and I saw a mighty stone, which twelve men were trying to move, and they could only lift it with the greatest difficulty."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5054" value="And that brother advanced, and rolled the stone along, and fixed it at the door of the habitation;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5143" value="and when I saw this I marvelled exceedingly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5180" value="Then I remembered the patriarch Jacob, and how he, when he fled from the face of Esau his brother, went into Mesopotamia of Syria, and how when he had arrived at the place wherein were the sheep of Laban"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5361" value="he went up to the well, and rolled away the stone which was on the mouth thereof, without any man giving him assistance, and how he watered the sheep of Laban and then sent them away to feed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5491" value="And finally I understood that in everything that the saints perform it is God Who helpeth them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5574" value="And I said unto him, 'O my holy father, shew me thy holy name, for God hath hidden this from me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5659" value="And he said, 'Cyrus is my name."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5704" value="I am the brother of the Emperor Theodosius, and I was reared and fed at the same table as Arcadius and Honorius. And, indeed, many, many times hath Honorius said unto me, 'Take me with thee into the desert, and I will become a monk';"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5889" value="but I did not wish to take him with me, because he is a son of the Emperor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5948" value="And when we saw that oppression (or, violence) had multiplied, and that the Emperors were committing' sin, and that the rulers were robbing the poor, and that everyone was turning out of the straight road, and making corrupt his path before God, I rose up, and I set out and I came to this desert, and I took up my abode therein because of the multitude of my sins."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6171" value="May God forgive me these!'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6200" value="And I, Pambo, said unto him, 'My beloved father, where a wilt thou find men in this desert place to comfort thee in thy sufferings?'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6294" value="And Apa Cyrus said unto me, 'Believe me, my beloved brother, Apa Pambo, my God and my Lord Jesus Christ are Those Who visit me in this desert wherein I live."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6430" value="For I have never seen a man who came to me except a certain brother who was a monk, and who came hither wishing to see my face, besides such a one I have never seen anyone."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6557" value="On the contrary, when any one came hither, whilst he remained outside I commanded him from inside this abode saying, 'Get thee gone, thou hast troubled thyself [to no purpose] in coming to me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6684" value="Most assuredly no man of flesh shall see my face except Apa Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet."/></featList></paula>
