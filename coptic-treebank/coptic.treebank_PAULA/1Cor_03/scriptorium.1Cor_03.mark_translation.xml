		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6" value="Brothers, I couldn&amp;apos;t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan107" value="I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren&amp;apos;t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan201" value="for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren&amp;apos;t you fleshly, and don&amp;apos;t you walk in the ways of men?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan313" value="For when one says, &amp;apos;I follow Paul,&amp;apos; and another, &amp;apos;I follow Apollos,&amp;apos; aren&amp;apos;t you fleshly?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan419" value="Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan551" value="I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan620" value="So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan714" value="Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan801" value="For we are God&amp;apos;s fellow workers. You are God&amp;apos;s farming, God&amp;apos;s building."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan887" value="According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1051" value="For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1133" value="But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1223" value="each man&amp;apos;s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man&amp;apos;s work is."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1389" value="If any man&amp;apos;s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1450" value="If any man&amp;apos;s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1542" value="Don&amp;apos;t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God&amp;apos;s Spirit lives in you?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1620" value="If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God&amp;apos;s temple is holy, which you are."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1712" value="Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1815" value="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, &amp;apos;He has taken the wise in their craftiness.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1915" value="And again, &amp;apos;The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1971" value="Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2006" value="whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2147" value="and you are Christ&amp;apos;s, and Christ is God&amp;apos;s."/></featList></paula>
