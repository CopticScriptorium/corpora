		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="The page numbers in the manuscript contain errors, skipping pages 32 and 34. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM's edition includes only Budge's transcription of the manuscript. It is not a diplomatic transcription based on reading and collation of the original manuscript. The translation is Budge's with very slight modifications (e.g., numbers mistranslated.)  The pb xml ids correspond to numbered pages in the ms as provided by Budge; if Budgeâ€™s edition omits the number we have extrapolated based on the provided page number; Budge notes on p XV of his edition that the pagination in this codex is sometimes irregular. Budge's title is, &amp;quot;The Discourse of Saint Athanasius, Archbishop of Eakote, on Mercy and Judgement.&amp;quot;"/></featList></paula>
