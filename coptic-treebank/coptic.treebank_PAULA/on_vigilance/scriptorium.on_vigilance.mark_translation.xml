		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7" value="[Why] do you subject [yourselves] to laws in the world as the living do:"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan63" value="'Do not touch, do not taste, do not approach.' This means: we have escaped the sins of the world by leaving them behind us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan183" value="Why do we now turn around and entangle us in them?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan236" value="And he has also said, at that time you were dark, but now you are light in the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan350" value="Walk as children of the light."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan382" value="For the fruit of the light consists purely in good things, in justice and truth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan459" value="Examine what pleases the Lord and do not take part in the fruitless deeds of darkness, which bear no fruit, but expose them instead."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan599" value="For what they do in secret is shameful to even mention."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan679" value="But each filthy work is exposed by the light."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan745" value="For everything which is manifest is light."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan796" value="Therefore, let us denounce our foolish notions and all inspirations by the devil, unbelief and hatred, as they inspire us to devise evil against each other, which will cause there to be no true connection among us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1022" value="And we blame each other and not ourselves, as if our struggle were to be against each other and not against the principalities and powers, against the world rulers of darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil that are under heaven – our fight should be against them, but not against flesh and blood."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1259" value="As the Apostle said: Reach for the armor of God, so that you can resist the crafty snares of the devil, because not against flesh and blood is our fight."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1433" value="Therefore, be vigilant and let us hold onto the good, because although many are together in the flesh, they are far apart in the heart and in terms of love."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1586" value="Many, however, who are not together in the flesh, they are together in the love of Christ and the Spirit and the desire for Jesus."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1733" value="But you, brethren, pay attention to yourselves and do not deviate from what we have learned."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1802" value="Then many will learn and profit from you, as he has said, your good works shall be seen, and your Father in heaven be praised."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1944" value="For just as you have modeled yourself after all the saints through your Christian way of life, as he said: But you, you have followed my teaching, my example, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions, my suffering, continue to imitate them by preserving for yourselves the fruits of your efforts."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2220" value="After all, who has imperishable riches in Christ, must also assure themselves of this wealth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2322" value="If already those who have earthly goods, gold, silver and other possessions, are vigilant so that robbers do not carry them off in secret, then we must watch all the more so that the enemy does not secretly carry off our merits: our prayers, our fasting practices, our chastity and our steadfastness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2584" value="The theft of silver and gold is not quite comparable to this, but the more respected virginity and the monastic life are, the more the enemy strives also to capture them unnoticed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2763" value="Who has obtained pearls or gold, stands guard."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2847" value="If even the enemy remains awake at night to commit a villainy, then the owner of the wealth will watch all the more so that they don’t fall victim to any attack."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2968" value="We want to remind ourselves of what our father said, brothers according to our way of life fast and pray and hold vigils, but they also lie, argue, are defiant, grumble and slander, hate, are hostile, fornicate and are devious: they commit every imaginable evil."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3305" value="Such people toil for nothing, and nothing good will happen to them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3380" value="Their steadfastness is of no benefit to them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3419" value="As has been said: He is not a full sheaf that he could give flour."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3492" value="In this regard has also been said: Sow wheat, and reap thorns."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3562" value="Their fields will bring them no harvest."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3602" value="Therefore keep watch and do not let the enemy destroy our merit while we make it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3681" value="Instead, we want to adamantly preserve our minds from any impure thought from the devil to become worthy to hear this with satisfaction (p 3): 'From now on, they will no longer work on an agency basis,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3845" value="but they will work for the Lord, their God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3888" value="Because thieves do not break into a house or anywhere else where there are no valuables, but only where they would find valuables."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4026" value="They also do not break into a place guarded against thieves, but where they know that no one watches, but everyone is asleep,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4152" value="it is there that they break in and rob, whatever they find,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4209" value="In the same way the devil does not rob the one who is vigilant and preserves the fruits of his effort, but the one whom he finds careless and without fear of God, not considering, in which state he will come into the hands of God, driven back and forth by every wind,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4489" value="this is the one whose fruits he robs ruthlessly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4555" value="Therefore now take courage and be vigilant, brothers, everyone who is of one mind with God and our fathers, and also with us, whether man or woman, young or old, here with us or with you!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4784" value="We will not allow our eyes sleep and our eyelids slumber until the Lord saves us from any temptation by the enemy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4855" value="Because there are many who envy us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4885" value="And give no heed to brothers, who are often involved in strife and rebellion, and disown their steadfastness. Do not let them become a stumbling block to you!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5010" value="God shall never be able to say that they are a stumbling block to the righteous, those who have complete faith in Christ and wait for the Spirit of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5167" value="But woe to you sinners who disown your steadfastness and throw the communities into turmoil through cowardice, envy, hatred, strife, rebellion and intrigue!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5348" value="What are you going to do on the day of your visitation?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5391" value="For your trouble comes from afar."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5431" value="Or is it no judgment for us that we - after we have left behind what we have left behind, and have entered into a contract with whom which we have entered into a contract, affirming under oath, 'We will not steal, lie, commit sexual misconduct, bear false witness, commit fraud secretly ', and all the points that come hereafter - that we then do these again [... 2 sheets ...]"/></featList></paula>
