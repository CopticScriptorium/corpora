		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="Collated in Naples by David Brakke, March 2009; transcription does not record spaces and paleographic rendition of letters other than ekthetics. English translation published in David Brakke's and Andrew Crislip's Selected Discourses of Shenoute the Great (Cambridge University Press, 2015).  It is likely the next work in Discourses Volume 5 (Whoever Seeks God Will Find) begins in the lacuna following this fragment."/></featList></paula>
