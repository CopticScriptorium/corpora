		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="A long lacuna follows in this codex (MONB.GF). The text picks up in another manuscript witness, codex MONB.CZ, after a lacuna of about 11 pages (not yet published in Coptic Scriptorium).  It is likely the next work in Discourses Volume 5 (Whoever Seeks God Will Find) begins in the lacuna following this fragment."/></featList></paula>
