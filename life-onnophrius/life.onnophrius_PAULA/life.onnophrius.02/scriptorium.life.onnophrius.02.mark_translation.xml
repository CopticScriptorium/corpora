		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan159" value="When they begin to lead the life of the anchorite they rejoice exceedingly because of hunger, and thirst, and the excellence of their manner of life."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan260" value="And the Adversary who fighteth with them to tempt them thereby doth not wish them to continue the life of the anchorite, for he knoweth that the reward is great which they will receive from God when they shall come forth from the body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan440" value="When they are preaching ascetic labours the compassion of God cometh upon them, and He maketh the angels to serve them in respect of their food, and He bringeth for them water out of the rock."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan588" value="For it is written in Isaiah, Those who abide patiently in the Lord shall renew their strength."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan655" value="They shall spread out their wings like the eagles in flight."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan713" value="They shall journey and shall not suffer hunger."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan738" value="He saith, Water shall be brought to them out of the rock. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan789" value="When they suffer hunger He will make the grass which is in the field to be sweet to their mouths, even as honey is sweet. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan884" value="If tribulation come upon them, or danger rise up against them, straightway they spread out their hands and they pray to the King Jesus until there cometh to them speedily His help which He sendeth forth, and straightway He strengtheneth them because of the integrity of their heart in respect to Him."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2106" value="And when he knew that I was afraid, he said unto me, `Fear not, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2163" value="for I am the angel that dwelleth with thee, and that hath travelled with thee from thy childhood; "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2227" value="this stewardship, which the Lord hath appointed to thee, thou shalt be able to fulfil.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2293" value="``And when I had come into the mountain, and I had journeyed in the desert for six or seven miles, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2364" value="I saw a cave, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2383" value="and I turned towards it, for I saw that there was a man inside it."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2679" value="The Lord be with thee. Thou shalt succeed in the good work whereunto He hath invited thee.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2748" value="And I went inside,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2768" value="and I sat down there with him for a few days, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2806" value="and I learned the rules of the doctrine of God from him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2854" value="and he taught me the regulations which governed the life of the monk in the desert. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2894" value="And when he saw that I was acquainted with the hidden and terrible fighting which existed in the desert, he said unto me, `Rise up, my son, and let me take thee to a desolate place in the inner desert, and thou shalt abide therein by thyself for God's sake."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3085" value="Since God hath appointed thee to this work thou must dwell in the desert."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3145" value="And straightway he rose up, and journeyed with me into the desert for a distance of four days' journey,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3214" value="and at the end of the four days we came to a small hut, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3274" value="And he said unto me, 'This is the place which the Lord hath appointed thee to live in.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3347" value="And he sat down with me for a month of days, until I understood the good work which it was meet for me to do. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3434" value="And afterwards he departed from me,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3465" value="and we never saw each other again until this year when I saw him once on the day whereon he laid down the body,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3543" value="and I buried him inside the place wherein he was.''"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3589" value="And I (i.e. Papnoute) said unto him, ``My good and beloved father, at the beginning, when thou didst first come to this place, didst thou suffer from the weather?''"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3848" value="and my flesh was wasted away by the dews of heaven. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3889" value="And when God [saw] that I endured patiently in my good strife of fasting, and that I gave my heart to ascetic practices, He made holy angels serve me, and bring to me my daily food, and an angel gave it to me evening by evening, and he stood by my body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4111" value="And the palm-tree yielded unto me each year twelve bunches of dates, and I ate one bunch every month. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4206" value="And, moreover, he made the herbs (or, grasses) which grow in the desert to be sweet to my mouth, even as honey. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4290" value="For it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which cometh forth from the mouth of God doth man live. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4409" value="If thou doest the will of God, He shall take care of thee in every place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4464" value="For He hath said in the Holy Gospel, Take no care for what ye shall eat, or for what ye shall drink, or with what raiment ye shall clothe yourselves, for your Father Who is in heaven knoweth of what things ye have need without your asking Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4658" value="Seek ye His kingdom and His righteousness,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4692" value="and these things shall be added unto you."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4844" value="And he said unto me, ``O my holy father, an angel cometh and administereth to me the Sacrament on the Sabbath Day and on the First Day of the week. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4892" value="And the angel cometh and administereth the Sacrament to every one who is in the desert,"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5095" value="And, moreover, when they desire to see any one, they are taken up into the heights of heaven, and they see all the saints, and they salute them, and thereby their hearts receive light, and they rejoice, and are glad with God in those good things. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5288" value="And when they see them they receive consolation, and they forget that they have suffered in any way; and afterwards they return to their bodies, and they continue to feel comforted for a very long time. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5429" value="And if they are transferred to another world through the joy which they have seen they do not even remember that the world existeth.''"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5522" value="And when I had heard these things I rejoiced exceedingly that I was held to be worthy to hear them from him. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5592" value="And I forgot all the sufferings which I had endured when I was journeying in the desert, "/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5692" value="and renewed power came to my body and to my soul."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5736" value="And I said unto him, ``Blessed am I that I am held to be worthy to see thy holy face, and to hear thy sweet words.''"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5843" value="Then he said unto me, ``Rise up, O my brother, and let us depart to the place wherein we are to be.'' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5918" value="And we rose up,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5932" value="and we journeyed on, and we came to a hut."/>
