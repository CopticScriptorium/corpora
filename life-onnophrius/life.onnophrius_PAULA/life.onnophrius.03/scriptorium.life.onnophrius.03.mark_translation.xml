		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan168" value="and I saw a loaf of bread and a vessel of water. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan217" value="And he said unto me, ``Rise up, my brother, and eat, and drink this small quantity of water, for I see that thou art exhausted by hunger and thirst, and by the toil of the road.'' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan356" value="And I said unto him, ``As God Almighty liveth, I will neither eat nor drink unless we stretch ourselves out and eat the bread together.'' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan477" value="And when I continued to press him with difficulty [he agreed], and we stretched ourselves out together,"/>
