		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9" value="Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan165" value="He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan237" value="Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan292" value="and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan365" value="Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan481" value="When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan541" value="Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan624" value="Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan727" value="He said, 'Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan794" value="When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2483" value="For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2572" value="But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2638" value="He said, 'How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?"/>
