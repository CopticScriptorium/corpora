		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7" value="It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan129" value="For they said, &amp;apos;Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan188" value="While he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard--very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan347" value="But there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, &amp;apos;Why has this ointment been wasted?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan414" value="For this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.&amp;apos; They grumbled against her."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan507" value="But Jesus said, &amp;apos;Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan610" value="For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan727" value="She has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan794" value="Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan924" value="Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1008" value="They, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1123" value="On the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, &amp;apos;Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1236" value="He sent two of his disciples, and said to them, &amp;apos;Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2372" value="He said to them, &amp;apos;This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2444" value="Most certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2584" value="When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2630" value="Jesus said to them, &amp;apos;All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, &amp;apos;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.&amp;apos;"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2780" value="But Peter said to him, &amp;apos;Although all will be offended, yet I will not.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2844" value="Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2953" value="But he spoke all the more, &amp;apos;If I must die with you, I will not deny you.&amp;apos; They all said the same thing."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3083" value="They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, &amp;apos;Sit here, while I pray.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3177" value="He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3259" value="He said to them, &amp;apos;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3336" value="He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3436" value="He said, &amp;apos;Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3541" value="He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &amp;apos;Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn&amp;apos;t you watch one hour?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3644" value="Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3726" value="Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3777" value="Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn&amp;apos;t know what to answer him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3893" value="He came the third time, and said to them, &amp;apos;Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4052" value="Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4113" value="Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4245" value="Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, &amp;apos;Whoever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.&amp;apos;"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4454" value="They laid their hands on him, and seized him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4498" value="But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4570" value="Jesus answered them, &amp;apos;Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4675" value="I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn&amp;apos;t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4758" value="They all left him, and fled."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4791" value="A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4856" value="but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4915" value="They led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5008" value="Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5120" value="Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5220" value="For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn&amp;apos;t agree with each other."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5291" value="Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5348" value="We heard him say, &amp;apos;I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.&amp;apos;&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5469" value="Even so, their testimony did not agree."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5509" value="The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, &amp;apos;Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5625" value="But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, &amp;apos;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5749" value="Jesus said, &amp;apos;I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5864" value="The high priest tore his clothes, and said, &amp;apos;What further need have we of witnesses?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5943" value="You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?&amp;apos; They all condemned him to be worthy of death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6052" value="Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, &amp;apos;Prophesy!&amp;apos; The officers struck him with the palms of their hands."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6203" value="As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6270" value="and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, &amp;apos;You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6384" value="But he denied it, saying, &amp;apos;I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.&amp;apos; He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6506" value="The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, &amp;apos;This is one of them.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6582" value="But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, &amp;apos;You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6695" value="But he began to curse, and to swear, &amp;apos;I don&amp;apos;t know this man of whom you speak!&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6778" value="The rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, &amp;apos;Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.&amp;apos; When he thought about that, he wept."/></featList></paula>
