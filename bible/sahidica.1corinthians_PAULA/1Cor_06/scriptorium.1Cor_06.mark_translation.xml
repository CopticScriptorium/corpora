		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan295" value="If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan367" value="I say this to move you to shame. Isn&amp;apos;t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?"/>
