<feat xlink:href="#translation_116" value="Don&apos;t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn&apos;t tempt you because of your lack of self-control."/><!-- ⲙⲡⲣ.... -->

<feat xlink:href="#translation_963" value="but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_989" value="There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin.
