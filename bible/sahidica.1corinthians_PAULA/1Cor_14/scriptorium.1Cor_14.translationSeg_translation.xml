<feat xlink:href="#translation_1" value="Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."/><!-- ⲡⲱⲧ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_19" value="For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_54" value="But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_75" value="He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_100" value="Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up."/><!-- ϯ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_145" value="But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?"/><!-- ⲧⲉⲛⲟⲩ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_191" value="Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn&apos;t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?"/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_241" value="For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?"/><!-- ⲕⲁⲓ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_265" value="So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air."/><!-- ⲧⲁⲓ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_314" value="There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning."/><!-- ⲟⲩⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_333" value="If then I don&apos;t know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me."/><!-- ⲉⲓϣⲁⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_365" value="So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly."/><!-- ⲧⲁⲓ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_392" value="Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret."/><!-- ⲉⲧⲃⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_408" value="For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful."/><!-- ⲉⲓϣⲁⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_428" value="What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."/><!-- ⲟⲩ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_460" value="Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the &apos;Amen&apos; at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn&apos;t know what you say?"/><!-- ⲉⲙⲙⲟⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_503" value="For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up."/><!-- ⲛⲧⲟⲕ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_518" value="I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all."/><!-- ϯ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_536" value="However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language."/><!-- ⲁⲗⲗⲁ.... -->

<feat xlink:href="#translation_591" value="In the law it is written, &apos;By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.&apos;"/><!-- ϥ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_629" value="Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe."/><!-- ϩⲱⲥⲧⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_664" value="If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won&apos;t they say that you are crazy?"/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_708" value="But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all."/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_739" value="And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed."/><!-- ⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_779" value="What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up."/><!-- ⲟⲩ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_834" value="If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret."/><!-- ⲉⲓⲧⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_860" value="But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God."/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_884" value="Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern."/><!-- ⲡⲣⲟⲫⲏⲧⲏⲥ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_900" value="But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent."/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_918" value="For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted."/><!-- ⲟⲩⲛ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_941" value="The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,"/><!-- ⲛⲧⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_952" value="for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,"/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_983" value="let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says."/><!-- ⲛⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_1018" value="If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly."/><!-- ⲉϣⲱⲡⲉ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_1048" value="What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?"/><!-- ⲏ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_1071" value="If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_1102" value="But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant."/><!-- ⲡ.... -->
<feat xlink:href="#translation_1117" value="Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don&apos;t forbid speaking with other languages."/><!-- ϩⲱⲥⲧⲉ.... -->
