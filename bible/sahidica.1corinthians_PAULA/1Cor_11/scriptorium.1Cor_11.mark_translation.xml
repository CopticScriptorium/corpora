		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8" value="Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan59" value="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan167" value="But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan292" value="Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan359" value="But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan493" value="For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan611" value="For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan728" value="For man is not from woman, but woman from man;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan805" value="for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan872" value="For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan932" value="Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan981" value="For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1113" value="Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1182" value="Doesn&amp;apos;t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1255" value="But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1344" value="But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God&amp;apos;s assemblies."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1427" value="But in giving you this command, I don&amp;apos;t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1510" value="For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1604" value="For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1679" value="When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord&amp;apos;s supper that you eat."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1743" value="For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1829" value="What, don&amp;apos;t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God&amp;apos;s assembly, and put them to shame who don&amp;apos;t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don&amp;apos;t praise you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1983" value="For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2102" value="When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, &amp;apos;Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2196" value="In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, &amp;apos;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2331" value="For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&amp;apos;s death until he comes."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2422" value="Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord&amp;apos;s cup in a manner unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2534" value="But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2633" value="For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn&amp;apos;t discern the Lord&amp;apos;s body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2720" value="For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2787" value="For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn&amp;apos;t be judged."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2843" value="But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2921" value="Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2970" value="But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come."/></featList></paula>
