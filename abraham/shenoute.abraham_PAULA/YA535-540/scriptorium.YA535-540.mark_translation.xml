		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9" value="that he will not take vengeance on those who kill them and whip them even as they [drag?] them "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan92" value="and who throw them out of the city, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan127" value="as happened to all [the prophets and apostles] in the synagogues and the sanhedrin,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan185" value="and as was done to them by governors and kings, with great sufferings even unto death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan266" value="And so we remember the sufferings of all the saints,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan324" value="and we consider how our Lord Jesus despised shame"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan395" value="as he remained steadfast on the cross for all our salvation,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan439" value="because he is our savior, he is our Lord and our father. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan490" value="And also we know that the good and compassionate God supports all of us from the start of the earth to the ends of the inhabited world,"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan802" value="Therefore let us not renounce such that we do not support our companions, so that God does not become angry with us, for because we did not delay to support our companions as the Lord, in the way the Lord, and his Christ, and his holy angels have supported us from the beginning of creation until today and forevermore."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1034" value="But let us be servants to one another, like Jesus, who took the form of a servant for us,"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1525" value="Therefore, when the Lord Jesus realizes that our fathers, the apostles, would do anything that he commanded them to do, he will leave them up to heaven, according to the Scriptures;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1681" value="and thus they completed what he commanded them to do from the beginning, while the Lord of glory, Jesus, was with them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1799" value="Therefore he said to them, 'I will not call you my servants from now on  because the servant does not know what his master is doing."/>
