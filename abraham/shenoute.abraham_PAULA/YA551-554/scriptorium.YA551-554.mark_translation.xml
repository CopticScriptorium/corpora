		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan27" value="Let us not be traitors and thieves, so that we are not like Judas about whom it was said, with the Holy Spirit's help, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan147" value="Let the curse descend on him like water and oil in his bones.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan239" value="Therefore let us not be deceitful in the presence of the Lord, through any wicked deed, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan322" value="either a pollution or a defilement, or thieving or lying, or hatred or bragging or hypocrisy, and vainglory.  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan447" value="Who are the braggarts but those who shout, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan495" value="and who put their noses in the air and look down at those who guide them, "/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan626" value="so that they might live orderly according to God&amp;apos;s ordinances?  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan676" value="Who are the hypocrites but the people who live with [braggarts] and conceal their transgressions through every wickedness? "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan800" value="Therefore let us not be deceitful falsely, and conceal our sins from our companions "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan868" value="because that causes disturbances in every community, when people sin in the presence of God for all time.  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan972" value="But let us teach our companions by instruction not to sin in the presence of the Lord.  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1047" value="And if we stumble and act wickedly through a mistake, let us share blame with our companions "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1110" value="because that is the strength and the foundation of every community which is pleasing to God for all time. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1206" value="Indeed it is not wonderful whenever we act like the false prophets and we conceal our sins from our companions, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1290" value="and God must pour his curse on us angrily and wrathfully.  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1357" value="But the wonder occurs whenever we follow the pattern set by our fathers, the prophets and apostles "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1436" value="and we teach our companions not to sin in the presence of God;  "/>
