		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8" value="O man, flee quickly from sin, and remember death immediately."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan76" value="For it is written, 'A wise man suppresseth sin, and the face of the ascetic shall shine like the sun.'"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan453" value="Do not seek after a seat of glory among men, so that God may shelter thee from the blast of the storm of which thou knowest nothing, and may apportion thee a seat in His metropolis, Jerusalem of heaven."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan599" value="Test everything."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan627" value="Lay hold upon that which is good. Similarly, do not treat with contempt the image of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan692" value="Moreover, keep diligently thy youth with all care, in order that thou mayest be able to keep diligently thine old age with all care, lest thou be put to shame, and thou come to an end in the Valley of Jehoshaphat."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan796" value="The whole creation of God shall look upon thee, and they shall revile thee, saying,"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1008" value="O what great shame! Whilst thou didst walk in the world men gave glory to thee thinking that thou wast a man of moral excellence; the moment, however, that thou comest to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the place of judgement, thou art found to be naked."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1184" value="And every one looketh upon thy sins, and upon thy shame which is revealed to God and man."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1405" value="What wilt thou do in that hour? Thou wilt weep, but they will not accept weeping from thee. Thou wilt make supplication, but they will not accept supplication from thee because the beings into whose hands thou shalt be given are merciless."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1563" value="O woe be unto thee in that hour wherein thou shalt hear that terrible voice which shall give judgement, saying, 'Let the sinners return to Amente.'"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2588" value="Flee thou to the Lord at every hour, sit thou down in the shadow of Him, for he who abideth in the help of the Most High shall be under the shadow of the God of heaven, and he shall never be moved."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2738" value="Remember thou the Lord and the Jerusalem of heaven; let (the memorial thereof) go up in thy heart, and thou shalt be under the blessing of heaven, and the glory of God shall support thee."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3042" value="And he who is at peace with his brother is at peace with God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3103" value="Now thou knowest that there is no state of peace greater than that every man should love his brother ; but if thou art free from sin of every kind but art at enmity with thy brother, thou art a stranger unto God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3274" value="For it is written, 'Seek after peace and purity, for they are bound together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3336" value="And again it is written, 'And even if I have all the faith, so that (I can) remove a mountain, without love of heart, I am benefited in nothing."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3452" value="Love buildeth up."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3474" value="There can be no purity in impurity. If hatred existeth in thy heart, or enmity, where is thy purity?"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4216" value="In how great danger, then, of punishment are we if we hate each other, our neighbour who is yoked unto us, the sons of God, the branches of the true Vine, the sheep of the rational fold, which the True Shepherd hath gathered together, the Only-begotten Son of God, Who offered Himself up as a sacrifice for us, which (i. e. the danger) was so great that the Living Word bore these sufferings Himself. And thou thyself, dost thou hate him?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4559" value="O man, wherefore art thou envious of the glory which is empty?"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11155" value="Therefore let all those who have prepared themselves to be disciples of Jesus keep themselves away from wine and from drunkenness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11245" value="For our fathers knew very well the danger which would arise because of wine, and they abstained from it, for they were wont to drink it in very small quantities when suffering from sickness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11367" value="Now if only a very little wine was allowed to be given to the mighty workman Timothy, whose body was in a very infirm condition, then what shall I say in respect of the man who is bubbling over with wickedness, and is in the prime of early manhood, and who hath in him impure desires and passion in abundance?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11531" value="I am afraid to say it: Let no man drink wine at all, so that he may not hate his own salvation (and) murmur against me."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan11862" value="And again, a greater thing than all these hath been given into thine hand, namely, the humility which keepeth watch over all the virtues ; humility was this great and holy power wherein God arrayed Himself when He came into the world."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12028" value="It is the wall (round about) the virtues, the treasure-house of actions (or, deeds), the armour which delivereth, the healer of every grief."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12113" value="And when the apparel of byssus had been made, and the vessels of gold for the tabernacle, and all the things for adornment, they put on apparel of sackcloth."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12389" value="Let us not relax our attention in the time of hunger, for boasting increaseth in a man as well as prudence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12465" value="When gluttony increaseth, fornication reigneth through the drinking of the body, (and) pride hath rule, and the novices cease to listen to the elders, and the elders cease to trouble in any way about the novices, and each one walketh according to the desire of his own heart."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan12899" value="Strive ye, O my beloved, for the time hath drawn nigh, and the days have diminished. The father no longer giveth instruction to his son, and the son hearkeneth not to his father."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13017" value="The good Virgins have come to an end. The holy fathers are asleep in every place, the mothers are destroyed like the widows, we have become like unto orphans."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13154" value="The humble are trampled upon, and blows are showered upon the heads of the poor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13214" value="Because of this, within a very little we have made God to be wroth. Then let us make lamentation, (for) there is none to comfort us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13301" value="All these things have come upon us because we have not afflicted ourselves."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13718" value="Let us become lovers of men, and make ourselves companions of Christ, the Lover of mankind."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13750" value="Since we are vowed unto God, (we must lead) the life of the monk in love."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13801" value="Virginity doth not (mean) virginity of the body only, but the keeping of oneself from every sin."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13869" value="For in the Gospel certain virgins were rejected because of their careless slothfulness, whilst those who watched bravely went into the chamber of the bridegroom."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan13974" value="May it happen then that every one (here) may enter into that place for ever!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan14029" value="And as concerning the love of money by means of which fighting is carried on against us."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan14066" value="If thou wishest to gain for thyself these things (or, possessions) which are transient, and can be destroyed by fire, by great avariciousness, or by trafficking, or by violence, or by evil design, or by excessive manual labour, thou art not free to serve God, at least certainly not in every way."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan14295" value="If thou hast the eager desire to collect for thyself gold or bronze, remember that which He spake in the Gospel, saying, 'Thou man of no understanding, they shall carry away thy soul this very night; (and) the things which thou hast prepared unto whom shall they belong?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan14473" value="Of similar import too are the words, 'He gathereth together, (but) he knoweth not for whom he is gathering'"/>
