		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="Coptic SCRIPTORIUM's edition includes only Budge's transcription of the manuscript. It is not a diplomatic transcription based on reading and collation of the original manuscript. The translation is Budge's with very slight modifications (e.g., numbers mistranslated.) According to Budge's introduction, a colophon states that the MS was copied in the era of the martyrs 701, or AD 985. Although it circulated as one work, the Instructions is composite, consisting of at least two originally separate texts that were edited into one by a Pachomian community. The first part is considered to be an original composition of Pachomius. The second part is elsewhere attributed to Athanasius of Alexandria (BL, Or. 8802). In her monograph, The Text of a Monastic Discourse ([Cistercian Publications/Liturgical Press, 2017], p. 10-15), Carolyn Schneider argues that the second part was not written by the Alexandrian archbishop, but a late fourth-century Pachomian production."/></featList></paula>
