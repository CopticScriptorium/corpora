		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan359" value="My son, listen. Make thyself wise, and receive the instruction of truth (?)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan412" value="There are two ways (which thou canst follow)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan436" value=" Either make thyself independent, (or) hearken unto (i. e. obey) God as did Abraham, who forsook his [native] land, and made himself an exile, and lived in a tent with Isaac in the land of promise as a stranger."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan653" value="He shewed himself to be superior to the temptation, and he offered up Isaac as a sacrifice unto God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan710" value="In this matter God called him, 'My companion' (or, friend)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan746" value="And again, take to thyself the humility of Jacob, and his obedience, and his patient endurance, until he became a light, and he saw the Father of All, and was called 'Israel'"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2004" value="For gladness goeth with him that is humble, and thou shalt be satisfied with whatsoever thy soul desireth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2078" value="For the ways of God are with him that is lowly of heart, and with the humble man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2137" value="For He said, 'I look upon every one who is lowly in heart and humble.'"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2764" value="The spirit of fornication and impurity walk together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2815" value="The spirit of enmity and lack of sorrow walk together. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2876" value="Woe be to that miserable soul wherein these things take up their abode, and make themselves masters of it in such a manner that they drive it away from God"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2982" value="for it getteth out of its own control, and it is tossed about on this side and on that until it arriveth in the Tartarus of Amente."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3063" value="My son, hearken unto me. Be not thou careless"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3094" value="Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids, so that thou mayest be able to escape like a goat from those who would shear it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3177" value="For, O my son, all the spirits from my youth up have on many occasions made me weak,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3256" value="I came into the desert they used to afflict me to such a degree that my heart failed me, and I thought that there was not strength enough in me to stand up against the threat of the Serpent."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3375" value="For he used to persecute me on every side"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3409" value="if I came into the middle (to fight) he would close in upon me and do battle with me"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3513" value="My heart was in a state of black terror, and although I turned to this side and to that many, many times I could not find rest."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3589" value="But when we took refuge at the feet of God with weeping and with humility, and with fasting, and with vigils by night, the Enemy and all his spirits also became powerless in respect of me, and the joy of God came to me,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3742" value="and I experienced straightway the help of God, for through His support He teacheth the children of men His strength, and His Christ-like (affection)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3859" value="My son, do not use words of abuse to any man, lest peradventure thou mayest see some one paying (the man) honour, and must say, 'This one hath ended (his trouble), he receiveth refreshing.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3967" value="Take thou good heed to guard thyself against a thought of this kind, for it is exceedingly; and God I hateth him that payeth Him honour, if he be one who hateth his brother."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4069" value="And he who shall say concerning himself, 'I am something,' is nothing at all, and he only deceiveth himself; is there any one who can help him?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4180" value="He who is arrogant, and who maketh his heart like unto the heart of God, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4243" value="There is no one who can be compared with me,' let him hear now his Creator, saying, 'Thou shalt go down into Amente. They shall cast thee down with the dead, the worms shall gnaw pieces from thy body, and the Worm shall envelop thee.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4400" value="The man who hath gotten himself humility judgeth himself, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4482" value=" My sins are greater than those of every other man' he judgeth no man in any way whatsoever, and he abuseth no man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4578" value="Who art thou that thou shouldst judge a slave who doth not belong unto thee ?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4618" value="For him who hath fallen down his God is able to set upon his feet (again)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4672" value="My son, keep watch over thyself, and never abuse any man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4724" value="Taste thou all the virtues, and guard thou them carefully."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4765" value="If thou art a stranger, keep to thyself. Rush not into the company of men, and thou shalt not mingle with their works."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4848" value="(If) thou art a poor man make not thyself liable in respect of any matter, lest men revile thee; for poverty is an evil matter in the mouth of the wicked. Hast thou never heard (it said that) ' If ye feel hunger ye will feel aggrieved,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4976" value="and ye will speak evil things against the governor and against the fathers'?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5024" value="Again, observe carefully lest war be let loose on thee because of something which thou didst lack for thy fleshly need, and because food hath rendered thee blameworthy; but endure patiently, in spite of everything, and God shall work effectively (for thee) in secret."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5171" value="Remember Habakkuk in Judea, and Daniel in Chaldea,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5223" value="though there was a difference between them—for one used to rule in the palace—especially the case of Daniel; when he was down in the pit (and was intended) to become food for the wild beasts,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5327" value="He prepared a meal for him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5354" value="Remember Elijah in the desert, and the widow in Zarephath, who notwithstanding the scourge of famine and the pressure of hunger which weighed heavily upon her, and the helplessness of her old age, never lost heart,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5498" value="but she contended boldly, and prevailed and obtained the promise of God, and her house enjoyed abundance during the time of the famine."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5591" value="The giving of bread either in the time of abundance or in (the time of) poverty is not power if thou be once blameworthy through want."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5681" value="For it is written concerning the saints, 'They suffer want, they are afflicted, they endure tribulation,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5742" value="but they boast themselves in their troubles.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5778" value="If thou dost a contend in patience in the strife of the Scriptures, no servitude whatsoever shall come upon thee, according to that which is, written,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5859" value="'Do not let yourselves be deceived with eating, and drinking, or with the share at the festival, or with new moons, or with sabbaths, which shall be a covering for the things that take place.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5991" value="Meditate thou always on the words of God, endure sufferings patiently, and in everything give thanks."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6068" value="Flee thou from before the honour of men. Love thou him that revileth thee, in the fear of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6141" value="Let every man be profitable unto thee, and do thou make thyself profitable to every man. Continue thou in thy work and word which is good."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6233" value="Turn not back unto him that runneth behind thee, so that God may not hate thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6284" value="For the crown shall be unto those who continue [to contend], and ever more and more do thou hearken to God, so that thou mayest make Him to save thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6382" value="When thou art seated among the brethren, do not laugh at even the smallest word of scurrility (which thou mayest hear)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6445" value="Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego disregarded the jeering of Nebuchadnezzar, and for this reason he was unable to compel them (to worship) by the songs and music of his instruments neither was he able to trick them by meals at his table."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6583" value="And for this reason the flames of fire [of the furnace] which rose up to a height of forty-nine cubits were extinguished. And these men did not go over to the perverse (or, crooked),"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6658" value="but they were upright before Him that is upright, that is to say, God; and for this reason He made them chiefs over their enemies."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6735" value="And again, Daniel did not hearken unto the conversation of the Chaldeans, which was evil, and for this reason he became a chosen vessel of great value."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6822" value="And (the lions) fell down, and watched him with intelligent understanding, and he shut the mouths of the savage lions."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6909" value="Now therefore, O my son, if thou wilt set God before thee as thy hope, He will become a helper unto thee in the hour of thy strife;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7005" value="for it is right for him that setteth out to go to God to believe that He is, and that this wage (i.e. reward, or prize) shall be to those who seek Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7110" value="These words have been written down for us in order that we may believe in God, and that we, from the least among us even to the greatest, may strive in the contest with fastings, and with prayers, and with other kinds of service, until the spittle drieth in thy mouth through fasting."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7277" value="And God will not be unmindful of this, but thou shalt find all these again in the hour of thy necessity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7358" value="Only do thou humble thyself in everything."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7382" value="Set thy word behind thee, if thou wouldst have understanding of everything in peace."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7444" value="Accustom not thyself to treat (temptation) with contempt, but bear every temptation with gladness, for thou canst not know what honour may follow the temptation."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7539" value="Thou shalt not pray, 'Remove the temptation from me'; because it is better for thee that thou shouldst pray, and weep, and heave sighs until thou art saved, than for thee to abandon thy heart, and to allow it to carry thee away captive."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7698" value="man, what wilt thou do in Babylon? Thou wilt commit some disgraceful act in (that) strange land, because thou hast never been put to the test, and thou wilt cast God away from thee willingly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7809" value="For this reason, O my brother, do not abandon thy heart."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7851" value="Thou mayest perhaps forget for a short time"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7878" value="but thine enemies will never sleep, neither will they ever forget, either by night or by day, and they will attribute craft to thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7969" value="For this reason run not thou after greatness, lest thou be humiliated, and thine enemies rejoice over thee;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8032" value="run after humility, for he that exalteth himself shall be brought low, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8123" value="If thou art unable to make thyself independent, cling thou unto some one who doth work in the Gospel of the Christ, and thou shalt go forward with him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8227" value="Or do thou obey thyself, or submit thyself, to one who doth obey. Or make thyself to become strong, so that men may call thee Elias, or do thou obey a strong man, so that men may call thee Elisha;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8360" value="because since Elisha obeyed Elijah the spirit of Elijah came in a double portion upon Elisha."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8415" value="If thou dost wish to dwell among men make thyself to be like unto Abraham (when he lived) with Lot, and like Moses and like Samuel."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8494" value="If thou wishest to live in the desert, behold, all the prophets (have done so) before thee;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8557" value="make thyself like unto them. They spread themselves about in the deserts, and in the ravines of the hills, and in the caverns of the earth, they suffered privations, and they endured tribulations, and afflictions, and pains."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8652" value="Again He saith, 'The shadows of those who were martyred (?) and the spirlt(s) of the men who endured trial, and suffered tribulation, shall bless Thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8740" value="Moreover, when the thief uttered one word on the cross, God forgave him his sins, and took him into Paradise."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8832" value="Behold, how very great shall be thine honour if thou shalt endure temptation with patience, or the spirit of fornication, or the spirit of pride, or any bodily passion whatsoever."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8949" value="In short, thou must thyself strive in the struggle against the passions of the Devil, so as not to follow him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9014" value="And Jesus K shall graciously bestow upon thee His promises."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9051" value="Keep thou watch against sloth, for she is the mother of all vices."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9108" value="My son, flee thou from the desire of lust, for that it is which produceth the understanding of wickedness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9169" value="It will not permit a man to know the mystery of God,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9211" value="and it will make thee a stranger to the language of the Spirit;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9255" value="and it will not permit thee to bear the Cross of the Christ,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9301" value="and it will not permit the heart to breathe the blessings of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9347" value="Keep thou watch against the relaxation of the viscera, which shall make thee a stranger unto the good things of Paradise."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9421" value="Keep thou watch against the pollution of thy body, which shall provoke to wrath God and His angels."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9480" value="My son, turn thou to God ; thou shalt love Him, thou shalt flee from the Enemy, whom thou shalt hate, so that the graces of God may be with thee, and thou shalt inherit, as did Judah, the son of Jacob."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9623" value="For He saith, 'Judah, thy brethren' shall bless thee, thy hand shall be upon the necks of thine enemies, and the children of thy father shall act as slaves unto thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9732" value="Guard thyself against pride, for it is the beginning of every evil;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9792" value="the beginning of pride shall remove thee from God, and that which followeth in its train is callousness of heart."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9875" value="If thou keepest watch over thyself in respect of this, thy place of repose shall be the Jerusalem of heaven;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9934" value="if the Lord desireth thee He will give glory unto thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9971" value="Keep watch, and let not thy heart be puffed up, but continue in thy humility, and thou shalt remain in the glory which God giveth to thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10066" value="Keep watch and be sober. Blessed is he who shall be found keeping watch, for they shall appoint him to be over the property of his Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10172" value="And he shall enter into the Kingdom with gladness, and the companions of the Bridegroom shall love him, because he was to be found keeping watch in His vineyard."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10285" value="My son, be thou long-suffering in everything, for it is written, 'Make haste to make thyself a chosen one of God, a workman who hath no need to be ashamed.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10385" value="Set out on thy way to God after the manner of one who soweth and reapeth, and thou shalt enter into thy treasure-house (or, granary) of the good things of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10479" value="Do not turn away the face like the hypocrites, but treat with decision the wishes of thy heart; work for God, and work for thine own salvation."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10593" value="If the passion of the love of money attack thee, and envy, or hatred, or any one of the other passions, enter into thee, take thou to thyself the heart of the lion, take thou to thyself the heart of the mighty warrior, and do battle with them, and destroy them like Sihon, and Og, and all the kings of the Amorites;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10824" value="for the beloved Son, the Only-begotten, the King Jesus, fighteth for thee, and thou shalt inherit the city of the enemy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10905" value="Only cast out from thyself every kind of pride, and thou shalt be strong."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan10961" value="And observe. When Joshua, (the son) of Nun was bold (or strong), God gave his enemies into his hand."/>
