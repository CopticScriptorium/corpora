		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8" value="It’s not when the fox cries out, which is you, oh servant of Mammon, in voices that shout, that the lion, which is I, the servant of Christ, is afraid."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan129" value="I know it’s not against me you fight, but against Jesus who dwells inside the Christians. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan205" value="Jesus still conquers you yourself and your father the devil who dwells inside you, for which you hope. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan282" value="And they too on their part, with their father who dwells inside them, Jesus, on whom they depend. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan349" value="A person who has Jesus doesn’t ever have shame like you said."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan408" value="The shame of this place [i.e. this life], the glory of this place, I have forsaken them, for I know that which I’m looking out for. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan505" value="Those who have the glory and honor by the hand of Jesus what have they to do with the glory and honor of people?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan583" value="Indeed just as there is no &amp;apos;robbery&amp;apos; for those who truly have Jesus, as you said against me, since I have carried your gods quietly [i.e. took away your idols without them resisting],"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan703" value="and since I have had them bind your contempt and your shame to the gateposts of your house, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan764" value="written on pieces of papyrus—as they broke your urine, in jars like wine —upon the threshold of your house, and on your door and the doors of those who are like you,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan903" value="so also there is no freedom for those who trust in Kronos, which is you, and those who are like you in faithlessness and in every other impurity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1020" value="What act or which word among those which you have uttered is it, that does not constitute evidence against you that you belong to Satan? "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1118" value="It&amp;apos;s the letters, those that you tore up—didn’t I know even before I had sent them that you would tear them up,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1193" value="oh accomplice in the work of those who destroyed with the scribe’s knife the pages of the book of the words that the prophets sent in the name of God?—"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1309" value="they were thrown on the burning embers!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1347" value="Even as you said: “the people and my stewards take things to him,”  "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1414" value="it’s you telling us and revealing your evil, for it’s not that you want the children of God to carry an offering to his church, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1526" value="or to do another thing which is good in the name of Jesus. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1573" value="You will rejoice if you hear that they have gone to the oracles of demons,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1632" value="because you also worship and serve the creation rather than he who created all things, Jesus, who is blessed for all eternity, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1740" value="instead of listening or seeing them going to the feet of God in every place where he is called, and blessed, and given glory, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1875" value="If more than the many about whom you said, “They take things to him,” "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1933" value="if they transfer over to me without restraint—for I too am a good servant to them, for they are my brothers, gathering for them into treasures in heaven, the things that they give in honour of God—"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2077" value="is it that they took them from your house and the house of your fathers? "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2131" value="You rob those that are not yours oh evil man. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2179" value="You sin, however, and you lay down obstacles for those who give to the poor,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2241" value="while they know that the things that are given or that are given in charity for those who are in need belong to Christ, who gave them to them for joy"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2354" value="and to be rich in deeds that are good."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2393" value="Do I still sit upon the middle of your head?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2439" value="For you say: &amp;apos;Until what happens won&amp;apos;t he sail away, since he says &amp;apos;I will go&amp;apos;, while he throws away day after day?&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2535" value="Why is it that I’ve become this great burden down upon you in this whole way,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2596" value="[whether] I have gone to the Emperors or I haven’t gone. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2638" value="Aren’t the heavens and the land Christ’s, and all that is in them?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2702" value="Does your father Kronos for his part indeed have anything at all except sins, these that you are a cultivator of for him yourself and those who are like you,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2807" value="as you all sow and reap for him the acts of faithlessness and the lies, and the acts of violence, and the blasphemies and every evil deed."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2916" value="If you were a weed like this growing by yourself then it would be right to tolerate you until the harvest of the field according to the word of the Lord  that you blasphemed. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3048" value="But you are a thorn tree and a thistle on the roads, as you form an obstacle to those who walk; for this it is right to cut and to pull out your root."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3170" value="But since you still said in your empty words:"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3214" value="“If he were truly a monk then he wouldn’t have committed 3 murders in the 40 Days [=Lent],”"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3277" value="as you called the pigs and the cow that I slew in the houses of the pagans “murders”."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3355" value="I will say for my part as follows against your nauseating words: "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3404" value="if what I did is not right because I made an example of idol worshippers, then how much of a condemnation is it for you that you transgressed in the 40 Days,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3531" value="and in the great holy Easter that every one celebrates down to the God loving Emperors too."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3614" value="But you for your part make your butchers work for you during it, while you live in luxury and stray without fear, making others stray with you "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3732" value="because still you sent to me saying: "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3767" value="“come search my houses (see) if you find idols inside them” "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3815" value="after I have searched it on another occasion; "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3837" value="your house - I didn’t find any idols in it. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3878" value="Or don’t you have any others but those that I took?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3923" value="Or if I take the idols that are in your house, is it that I’ll be able to hide the sun in the sky and the moon and the stars that you worship?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4036" value="Or is it that I’ll build walls in the west so that you won’t pray to the west side? "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4108" value="Or is it that I’ll watch over the river and over your canals so you won’t pour libations  for Kronos down into flood waters, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4205" value="then that’s enough of you saying these words of blaspheme upon deception, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4256" value="oh man who has fallen down to great evils. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4299" value="For just as you are godless, so is the way that you oppress the poor in your violent doings, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4388" value="or isn’t it another kind of persecution when you pursue men, most of all the elders of the church "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4467" value="until you scare them out of their houses, in this very period no less, right in these great troubles that are upon the land as you come into their places, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4577" value="while there is no son and no father and nothing at all inside because they ran. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4640" value="While you all take their beasts and their wagon, and their hay as you take them to your gardens as you force them to turn  them around beyond their strength. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4757" value="And what about the great Easter too, you don’t release them to engage in celebrating it. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4826" value="Right down to new boats that you have built, and you make them launch them into the water during it [i.e. Easter], instead of mourning  during it. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4936" value="You have made them shout aloud while it’s not their desire,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4975" value="who is he who will be able to recount all your evils?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5015" value="As still you slaughter your calf when it is about to die, or if it exhausts [its] measure, being unuseful for your work, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5111" value="and you divide it piece by piece as is your will, and you throw it at them, right down to the widows, and the old men, the old women, the orphans and the strangers."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5245" value="And you extort them for copper beyond its value until you collect the price of the calf doubled for ones least of flesh, while they are bones on something useless."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5371" value="As still you give calves to them and cows according to the field for them to feed until they are strong enough for you to take them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5467" value="Some of them to give them to you in honour, you do nothing good for them in exchange. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5555" value="Whereas others are still fed to you in this way: horses, and asses, sheep, calves, and pigs."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5665" value="Oh would that you all would stop in this way"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5706" value="for you would have desired them in their animals"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5742" value="or even in other matters"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5766" value="You rob them by using them,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5794" value="some for naught,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5812" value="and others with a little honor,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5842" value="except for bread and wine, finding food and chaf."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5887" value="And barley for your animals with all the others"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5930" value="And as still you gather them, to make them watch over you and the boats at the time while you flee in the face of the barbarians."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6031" value="Or doesn&amp;apos;t the barbarian chase after them?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6069" value="It&amp;apos;s their wives and their children and the furniture of their poverty upon their livestock."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6122" value="And in their wagons as they run for their part out of their places to other places to make them rescue themselves."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6196" value="This is the way that many of them hire men under their pay and send them to you to watch over you"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6279" value="And you are not content with these things."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6316" value="But rather you still add to your violence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6353" value="Just as you still extort from some people a vessel full of wheat for the house, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6409" value="because they are numerous—some twenty five dry measures, others one measure of grain."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6471" value="through the pretext of washing in baths "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6503" value="as they weep, &amp;apos;We don&amp;apos;t want to to bathe."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6536" value="We don&amp;apos;t have bread to eat. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6556" value="Such a thing is not our concern,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6590" value="while our children are hungry, while our children are naked.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6625" value="While their majority testifies, &amp;apos;We are not washing in baths.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6668" value="Aren&amp;apos;t they the ones who force them until they build them [i.e. the baths]?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6715" value="and other buildings as you force them concerning them [the buildings]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6756" value="Or it&amp;apos;s also farmsteads of a village."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6793" value="Wasn&amp;apos;t it you who also built their houses inside them?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6834" value="And every single one of these acts of oppression, you were oppressing them inside with your vengeance and your wine that is foul, with your labors and your violence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6939" value="Oh you men whom a sound threatens, &amp;apos;Those out of a quarrel who are disobedient of the truth, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7015" value="but obey violence;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7046" value="anger and rage and oppression,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7080" value="and the crushing of every human soul that does something evil.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7139" value="However I will say in your presence, the Lord of powers, ruler of all, don&amp;apos;t be angry at my stupidity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7213" value="I know that you do not forget anything."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7247" value="You, who have spoken through your holy prophets in the presence of this boastful man there, Pharaoh: &amp;apos;Let my people go,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7337" value="so that they may serve me or celebrate for me.&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7384" value="And you who have said through them, &amp;apos;Be at ease, as you know that I am God,&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7455" value="therefore, have pity on your people, o patient one, whose mercy is great."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7506" value="As you rescue them from those who oppress them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7556" value="In the way of your people, Israel at that time, so that they shall be at ease to know that there is no other god but you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7637" value="Or don&amp;apos;t you see that the pagans and the other peoples and the godless, were not able to know you, as they were not at ease in their apostasy?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7730" value="And all their impurities."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7757" value="Therefore, curb every lawlessness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7785" value="And every violence in every place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7813" value="From those who did violence to them, from the head of the land to the end of the world,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7888" value="those who know you shall be at ease to serve you."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7933" value="For they are not able to serve you, while they serve those who do violence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8004" value="Did you not rescue your people  Israel on that occasion from the hand of that lawless Nebuchadnezzar,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8079" value="and those others which are like him, who afflicted them in making you deliver them to their hands, since you were angry with them?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8174" value="And they even ask after you in those places, but they wouldn&amp;apos;t know to say your blessings in the way that they wish it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8272" value="As no open speech exists to them in the servitude of the deeds that are many."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8326" value="In the way that they said: &amp;apos;how will we be able to say the ode of the house of the lord in those of strange lands?&amp;apos;"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8430" value="In this way also if you don&amp;apos;t rescue those who have  violence done to them from the hands of these merciless ones,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8514" value="although they proclaim your name, but they wish also to do their desire since you are their hope."/>
