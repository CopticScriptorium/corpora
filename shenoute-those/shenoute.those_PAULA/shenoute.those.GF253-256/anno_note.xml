		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="Collated by Stephen Emmell, March 2005.  Emmel compared his collation with both Amelineau and Zoega, with Zoega being the more accurate but includes standard punctuation. The editors note the first 14 lines are in a slightly right-sloping script, with elaborate (but not colored) headband. At the start of line 1 there is an asterisk, and thereafter a column of diples alternating with straight lines. David Brakke and Andrew Crislip published an English translation of the text God Says Through Those Who Are His in their book Selected Discourses of Shenoute the Great (Cambridge University Press, 2015), pp. 266-277."/></featList></paula>
