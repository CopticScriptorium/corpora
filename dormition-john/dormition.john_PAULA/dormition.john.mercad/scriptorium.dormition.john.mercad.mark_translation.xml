		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan141" value="The blessed John was in Ephesus with the brethren,  rejoicing in the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan198" value="Now on the first day of the week all  the brethren were gathered together"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan258" value="and John began to speak to them, saying, ' My brethren, my fellow heirs, and  my partners in the Christ Jesus, our Lord, know ye that  unto you hath the Lord given from His hand power"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan425" value="[and]  that He hath wrought for you very many mighty works, and  miracles, and acts of grace."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan459" value="And ye know of what kind are the teachings, and the guiding directions, and the refreshing,  and the service, and the gracious acts, and the gifts, and all  the other things which ye see with your eyes"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan663" value="He hath never made Himself manifest unto you through the eyes of the body, neither have ye hearkened unto Him through the ears  of the body, but He hath made Himself visible unto you  through the integrity of your heart, and by visions, and by  works which are holy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan825" value="Strengthen ye yourselves, then, in  Him, and ye shall remember Him at all times; moreover,  ye shall also remember the mystery and the association (or,  partnership) which hath come unto you"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan952" value=" and which our Lord hath fulfilled. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan978" value="And now, O brethren. He maketh supplication to you  through Himself, and He appealeth unto you, wishing to make you to cease to grieve Him overmuch, or to despise  Him, or to conspire against Him"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1325" value=" Do not make to grieve through you the Good God, the Merciful, the Long-suffering, Him Who is without spot, Him Who is without blemish, the Ineffable, the God Who is One alone, the Unchanging One, Him Who is without guile, Him Who is without wrath, the Name which is above every name which men can comprehend."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1513" value="Let Him but rejoice with you, and ye enjoy free and happy citizenship with Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1555" value="Let Him but have gladness with you, and ye live in happiness and innocency."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1610" value="Let Him but repose in  your hearts, and ye are turned into beings who rejoice in  holiness of life."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1659" value="Let Him but shew Himself unmindful of  you, and ye must live in painful restraint. "/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1776" value="Let Him but  laugh, and ye become ready [to follow Him]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1807" value="I say these things, then, unto you, O my brethren, because  I hasten to embark on a certain matter which hath been laid  upon me, and of which the completion shall be unto me by the help of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1962" value="For of what kind is the other matter which I shall say unto you, there being for you the pledge  of your God?"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2205" value="[but] if even after ye  have had knowledge of Him ye continue and persist in the the judgement, and [then] they shall deliver you over to the  fire.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2331" value="And having said these things, [Saint John] prayed, saying: 'Jesus, Who didst weave the crown which was in Thine own garland (?)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2438" value="O Thou Who didst make the crown of all the saints, and these plants which are of many kinds, and hast changed men into Thy flowers which do not wither and fade!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2556" value="O Thou Who hast spoken Thy words in our hearts!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2598" value="Thou Who alone dost have a care for Thy servants!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2634" value="O Thou Physician of our bodies. Who dost heal them all for nothing!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2691" value="O Thou Who alone dost do good unto us!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2726" value="O Thou in Whom there is no pride (or, upliftedness of heart) whatsoever! "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2767" value="O Thou Who alone art the Compassionate, and art the Lover of all mankind!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2811" value="O Thou Who alone art the Saviour, and the Righteous One, Who existest in every place. Who hast existed from everlasting  God, the Christ Jesus."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2914" value="Thou art He Who sheltereth every one who putteth his hope in Thee, with Thy gift, and with Thy compassion. Thou knowest every wile and every crafty deed of the Enemy who doth wage war against us at all times.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3047" value="And when Saint John the Evangelist had made an end of saying these words, he took bread, and he gave thanks unto God in this manner, saying, ' What other blessing is there?  Or what other word can be spoken? Or what other giving of thanks is there which we can pronounce over this bread  [which] we break, except Thou alone, the Lord Jesus, the  Christ?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3324" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee, O Lord Jesus the Christ, Whose Name hath been made manifest by the Father."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3397" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee because of Thy coming in through the door. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3435" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee for Thy holy resurrection from, the dead, which hath been made known unto us through Thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3527" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee, the Way."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3555" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee, the Seed, the Word, the Salt, the True Gem, the Holy Storehouse, the Plough, the Net, the Majesty, Who was sent for the sake of us, the children of men, that He might deliver the race of man. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3751" value="We ascribe glory unto Thee, the Truth, the Rest, the Glory, the Mighty Power, the Commandment, the Boldness  of speech, the Freedom, [and] our place of refuge. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3858" value="For Thou art the Lord, the Root of immortality. Thou art the Fountain which cannot be destroyed. Thou art the Strength which endureth throughout the Ages."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3956" value="Thy Name hath been set upon all these things here, so that we also may make our cry unto Thee through them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4032" value="For we know Thy Majesty which is invisible, and which doth not make itself  manifest unto us at this time."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4111" value="When Thou shalt have purified us, then we shall see Thee alone in the body which Thou hast changed from oldness into newness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4206" value="And as John was breaking the bread, he prayed over each one of his brethren, so that they might be worthy of the Grace of the Lord."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4297" value="Similarly Saint John himself, when he had tasted the bread, [prayed for himself]. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4362" value="John the Theologian spake after this manner saying, ' Let me, even me, have a portion with you, O my beloved.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4484" value="Then he said to Birros, 'Take with thee two brethren, and let them have baskets in their hands, and digging tools, and follow ye me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4585" value="Now Bibros (sic) was not by any means neglectful, and he did according to what he had been commanded by Saint John the Theologian, and the servant of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4720" value="And when the blessed John had come forth from his house, he went outside the gate of the city, and he gave orders that the exceedingly great multitude, which were following him and pressing upon him, should be made to withdraw, and to depart from him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4872" value="And when he had arrived at a place in the region wherein were the tombs which were of one of the brethren, he spoke unto the young men, saying, 'My sons, dig a grave in this place"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4975" value="and those who were there dug down into the ground."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5011" value="Then John the Theologian was commanding them, saying', 'Dig the grave very deep.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5083" value="And he was saying, 'Dig ye down much deeper '"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5134" value="and those who were there dug down deeper still."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5172" value="And he spake with them, and addressed words to them, and encouraged them, and counselled them unto edification, and he instructed them, and he persuaded them [to enter] into the Kingdom of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5305" value="And he prayed over each one of them. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5345" value="Now when the young men had finished making the grave in the place wherein they had dug it, they arranged  everything connected therewith in a seemly manner, according to what [Saint John] wished."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5454" value="Now we had no knowledge whatsoever [of what he was about to do]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5483" value="Then he took off the clothes which were upon him, and having stripped them off himself"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5530" value="he threw them down into the place which they had dug deep in the ground, and which was in the form of a chamber which spread out."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5623" value="Then John stood on his feet —  now the only garment which he had on him was a tunic which came down on both sides"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5717" value="and having spread out his hands he prayed thus saying, '[O Thou] God, Who hast chosen me for Thyself to be an Apostle to the heathen, and hast sent me forth into the world"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5873" value="Who hast made manifest the Prophets and His Apostles"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5919" value="Who hast never ceased from doing that which is good since the foundation of the world. Who deliverest every one who hath no strength."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6027" value="Who hast made Thyself to be apprehended by every man of reason, unto Whom every living thing ministereth through His foreknowledge."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6122" value="Who didst make our soul to have longings, and dost make it to be tranquil, or solitary and savage."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6204" value="Who dost Thyself make it to laugh to scorn its enemy."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6252" value="Who didst fashion it like unto Thyself when it was dead. Who didst make for it a law which it could distinguish in the abyss of lawlessness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6337" value="Who didst make it to vanquish its enemy by causing it to flee from him"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6386" value="Who didst give it Thy hand and didst deliver it  from Amente"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6448" value="Who didst not leave it to become a citizen of this world"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6485" value="Who didst teach it to escape from its enemy"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6522" value=" Who  didst make Thy knowledge to illumine every place."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6562" value="Thou Son of God, Thou Saviour, Thou Lord, Thou Orderer of the things which are in the celestial heights."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6631" value="Thou Guardian of the things which are on the earth, Thou Grace and Gladness of those who belong to Thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6700" value="receive Thou the soul of John, which belongeth to Thee, which Thou hast made to be worthy  of the knowledge of Thee"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6789" value="For it is Thou Who hast kept me up to this hour, and I have never at any time polluted myself with women. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6854" value="Thou didst appear unto me at the time when I was wishing to marry a wife in the period of my youth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6912" value="and Thou  didst say unto me, 'John, I have need of thee'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6969" value="Thou didst  in the beginning act"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6985" value="as the steward of my body, when the desires caused by the sicknesses of the body arose"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7031" value="it was Thou Who didst prevent me from gratifying them on many occasions when I was wishing to marry a wife."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7095" value="Afterwards Thou didst speak to me at the third hour of the day on the sea, saying, 'John, if it be that thou dost not in truth belong to Me, I will withdraw Myself from thee. Take thou a wife, and thou shalt make thyself to become blind in both thine eyes; thou shalt suffer grief, [then] thou wilt pray unto Me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7294" value="Thou it was Who didst open my heart three times in the same year"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7337" value="and Thou didst graciously bestow upon me other eyes, which did not make themselves visible."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7391" value="Thou it was Who didst make the joyful expectation of the contemplation of women to become to me an abomination."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7454" value="Thou it was Who didst deliver me from a fleeting phantasy, and didst keep me for the life which endureth for ever."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7537" value="Thou it was Who didst make me to become a stranger to the madness of evil which ariseth in the flesh, and didst make me to be remote from the death which is bitter."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7636" value="Thou it was Who didst deliver me from the second death, that is to say, the Gehenna of fire, and didst make me to stand up, being a pure man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7726" value="Thou it was Who didst stop the mouth of the disease which appertained to my soul"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7777" value="and didst prevent the committal of the act which appertained thereto, or rather the outward and manifest works which are wont to be performed by the body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7871" value="Thou it was Who didst deliver me, and' didst east out from my heart that which disturbed me sorely."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7938" value="Thou it was Who didst prepare me to come unto Thee in a state of innoceney (or, holiness)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7981" value="Thou it was Who didst make my thoughts concerning Thee to be unpolluted."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8030" value="Thou it was who didst graciously grant unto me the faith in Thee which was undivided."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8080" value="Thou it was Who didst make my thoughts and my counsels to incline ever more and more towards Thee."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8142" value="Thou dost give unto each man according to his works. It was Thou Who didst deposit in my soul the intention not to permit anything whatsoever except Thyself to enter into me. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8258" value="For what can I find which is more choice or more pure than Thee?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8324" value="And now I have found Thee. And I have fulfilled the stewardship which Thou didst commit to me"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8400" value="make me   therefore worthy to enjoy rest in Thy holy repose. Do thou bestow upon me graciously the perfection which is in Thee, that is to say, the sinlessness and the salvation, which cannot be described, and which cannot be pried into, and which are beyond the comprehension [of man]. I come unto Thee, my Lord Jesus, the Christ."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8619" value="Let the fire die down, and let the darkness withdraw itself, and let Chaos become helpless, and let the furnace of blazing fire be without power, and let Gehenna be extinguished, and let the holy angels accompany me. Let the Places which are on the right hand stand on their feet."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8895" value="May Diabolos be put to shame, and Satan made an object of ridicule."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8938" value="May his wrath be quenched, and may his raving madness be suppressed."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9212" value="And when John the Theologian had said these things, he looked towards the east, and he ascribed glory to God"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan9302" value="and stretching out his hands again he prayed, saying, ' Be Thou with me, O my Lord Jesus, the Christ.'"/>
