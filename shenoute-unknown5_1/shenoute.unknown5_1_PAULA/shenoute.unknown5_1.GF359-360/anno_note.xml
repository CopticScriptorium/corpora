		<feat xlink:href="#anno_1" value="Transcribed from microfilm by Paul Dilley, Spring 2005; collated in Paris by David Brakke, March 2010. This text either belongs to the end of God Says through those who are His or it belongs to a separate, unknown work. Because of uncertainty, chapter numbering begins at 101. Chapter divisions follow David Brakke's."/></featList></paula>
