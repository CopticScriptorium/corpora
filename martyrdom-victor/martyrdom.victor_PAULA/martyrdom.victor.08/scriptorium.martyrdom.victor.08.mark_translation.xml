		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan30" value="And he said to her, 'Offer up sacrifice now, O Stephanou,'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan70" value="and do not die an evil death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan87" value="And she said unto him, 'My name is indeed Stephanou, the interpretation of which is 'crown incorruptible,'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan149" value="and therefore I will not offer up sacrifice, because I wish to receive the crown which is (indicated by) my name."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan212" value="Then the duke was exceedingly wroth, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan244" value="and he commanded his soldiers to set her between two palm-trees, and to tie her to each of them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan281" value="And they pulled the trunks of the two palms close to her holy body by means of a rope, and tied them together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan330" value="And afterwards the two palms were released suddenly by cutting the rope, and in this way she was rent asunder down to the middle of her body, and she became two pieces."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan410" value="Thus she fulfilled her martyrdom in peace, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan447" value="and she departed into the heavens, unto Him whom she had loved, the Christ, in great glory, amen."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan519" value="Then the Duke passed the sentence of death upon Apa Victor, [and ordered his soldiers to] cut off his head."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan579" value="And the blessed man Apa Victor answered and said unto him, 'I give thanks unto my Lord Jesus the Christ, Who  hath given unto me these riches forever."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan693" value="Now, therefore, hearken unto me, and I will declare unto you the following things which have been revealed to me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan763" value="Now after I am dead ye yourselves shall also die, at the end of my eleventh [year]."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan817" value="'And as concerning the Duke Sebastianos, an ekstasis shall take place, and certain men in a town shall delay [in paying tribute], and he shall embark in his boat and depart to despoil them, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan917" value="and as (the crew) are tying the boat up to the bank, the Duke shall come forth. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan955" value="And as he is coming down from the boat by the landing plank he shall trip up, and the monobolis shall penetrate his foot, and the foot shall mortify, and he shall die in the twenty-fourth year after my death."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1071" value="And again, all the wise men and all the orators shall go and eat their midday meal together at the end of the eighth year after my death, and the house wherein they are shall fall upon them, and they shall all die together."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1214" value="And when Asterius, the governor of the camp, the same who delivered the written accusation of me to the Count, as a result of which he tortured me, shall tie up his ass on the north side of the Camp when he shall arrive there, and shall beat her, she shall bite him, and he shall fall ill and die."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1389" value="And after ten days the men of my household shall come seeking after my body; "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1443" value="Give it to them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1462" value="For I have already bought the funerary swathings for my body and my coffin in order that they may not bury me in the funerary equipment of a stranger."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1538" value="Only, I pray you, do not prevent my body from being given unto those who shall seek after it."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1592" value="For there shall be an exceedingly great upheaval of the sea, and mighty events shall take place in the spot wherein my body shall be deposited."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1690" value="And the people of the whole country shall come to my shrine, and many mighty deeds shall take place on the spot where they shall deposit my head,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1795" value="and the people of the whole country shall come to my shrine by reason of the mighty deeds which shall be done therein. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1867" value="I am a young man twenty years of age."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1909" value="I entreat you all, O my fellow soldiers, to let me depart to the presence of my Lord Jesus the Christ. This is the day which I have been (long) expecting,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2023" value="and behold, it hath come this day."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2054" value="And straightaway they tied a gag in his mouth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2095" value="And Apa Victor said unto the executioner, 'Dismiss me speedily, for the sake of the angels who have hold upon me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2178" value="Now the executioner was not pleased to do so, for he only struck his neck with the sword,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2236" value="And his head hung by the skin of his neck."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2262" value="And Apa Victor was in torture, and his spirit was sorely distressed in him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2309" value="And he looked up and saw Horian the Kourson, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2345" value="and he said unto him, 'Take the sword out of the hand of this lawless man, and do thou make an end of me, for this wicked man of Sioout hath already done very many evil thinks to me during my lifetime, and now also at my death he doth grievously afflict my spirit."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2502" value="May the Lord reward him according to what he hath done unto me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2560" value="And Horion the Kourson said unto Apa Victor, 'My lord, do not think in they heart concerning me that I would lift up my hand against my brother soldier."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2670" value="I swear by thy salvation, O my brother Apa Victor, and by the dire need which is on thee, that I have never stretched out my hand even against a bird, to shed its blood, and it is impossible for me to lay my hand upon thee (with violence)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2802" value="But I pray thee to remember me in the place whereunto thou departest.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2845" value="And Apa Victor answered and said, 'The Lord Jesus Christ shall shew mercy unto thee, for in this very same year thou shalt die, and the Lord shall forgive thee they sins. The enemy and the martyr shall come forth to thee, (and) I shall follow after them and shall sing hymns with them.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3056" value="And Horion placed his napkin before his face."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3098" value="And (Apa Victor) said unto him, 'O my beloved brother, I entreat thee most earnestly,'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3147" value="and (Horion) girded on the sword."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3175" value="And the camp was shaken three times. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3210" value="Then he cut off his head."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3232" value="He consummated his martyrdom. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3261" value="And Horion lifted up his eyes to heaven."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3303" value="and he saw the soul of Apa Victor, which Ausouel carried (to heaven) in a napkin made of byssus,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3369" value="and the saints saluted the soul of Apa Victor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3412" value="And when they had taken off the head of Apa Victor blood mingled with milk came forth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3469" value="And he consummated his glorious martyrdom on the twenty-seventh day of the month Parmoute, at the tenth hour of the day."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3551" value="And all the words which he spake before they took off his head came true. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3615" value="Peace be upon every one who hath suffered martyrdom for the Name of our Lord Jesus the Christ, to Whom be the glory, and to His Good Farther, and to the Holy Spirit, life-giving and consubstantial, now and always, forever and ever, amen."/></featList></paula>
