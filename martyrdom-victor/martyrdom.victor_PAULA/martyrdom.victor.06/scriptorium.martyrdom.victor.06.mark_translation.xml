		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4502" value="And I will make them to come to thy shrine and to bring gifts unto thee in My Name."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4570" value="I will make many mighty wonders and signs to become manifest at thy shrine."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4622" value="Whosoever shall come to thy shrine, and shall make a vow, and shall not pay the same, because of these unpaid vows will I enter into judgement with them."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4704" value="As for this tower wherein thou dwellest, the multitudes who shall come thereto shall not destroy it, (The story of) thy life and conversation and of thy great valour shall reach the uttermost ends of the earth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4813" value="This year shalt thou dwell in exile, but in the next year they shall cut off thy head with the sword in this Camp"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4905" value="for thou shalt suffer certain pains for My Names sake."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5131" value="And Jesus kissed him, and He departed into heaven, and the angels sang hymns to Him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5213" value="And Apa Victor continued to live in the Camp, and the Lord Jesus was with him."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5280" value="And Apa Victor purchased for himself the materials for his burial, and his coffin."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5331" value="And large numbers of soldiers flocked to the Camp for the sake of the blessed man Apa Victor."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5392" value="And the blessed man Apa Victor doubled the number of the prayers which he used to make, and he ke2)t fasts for very long periods, and  he diligently observed the Sabbaths, and the Lord Jesus was with him. In the peace of God, May His holy blessing be with us! Amen"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5593" value="THE FOURTH MARTYRDOM OF APA VICTOR. IN THE PEACE OF GOD. BLESS US. AMEN."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5695" value="And it came to pass that after Saint Apa Victor was  banished he lived in the Camp."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5765" value="And Sebastianus, the Duke, came to inspect the Camp."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5816" value="And Asterius, the praetor of the Camp, cast himself down before the Count, and Soterichos, who was the accountant (or, clerk), gave him a written statement concerning Apa Victor, so that he might summon him into his presence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5972" value="Then the Duke ordered his servants to set  his judgement throne inside the gate of the Camp, in order that he might hear (the case of) the holy man Apa Victor. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6081" value="And when the morning had come the Duke took his seat upon the throne, and he commanded his servants to bring the righteous man into his presence."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6173" value="And the torturers seized Apa Victor whilst he was in his cell, and he had lentils in his hand, and he was eating"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6254" value=" and Apa Victor threw the lentils through the window, saying"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6321" value="O my Lord Jesus the Christ, do Thou make these lentils to become stones which shall never be destroyed! And they shall be a sign unto all the generations which are to come, lest these wicked men tread them down.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6458" value="And Apa Victor prayed, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6504" value="O my Lord Jesus the Christ, let me not be put to shame before this wicked man.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6562" value="And afterwards he came down (from his cell), and stood before the Duke. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6633" value="And the Duke said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6652" value="These are the letters which  the Emperor hath sent to be read unto thee ; hearken unto  them, and offer up sacrifice.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6738" value="And Apa Victor answered and said,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6764" value="I belong to a King Who is deathless, and therefore I will not worship an emperor who will die."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6846" value="kingdoms of the world shall perish and be destroyed, but the glory of God shall never, never perish; therefore I will not offer up sacrifice."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6972" value="For the pomp and glory of this world are nothing as compared with God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7017" value="Verily, I know well that I did receive a salary of sixty from my father, who is a general, and that God hated me because I received these things wickedly."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7143" value="Now therefore, O Duke, neither gold nor silver will be of the least value to a man in the hour of his necessity."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7227" value="For this reason let us fight with ourselves, for forgetfulness hath spread itself over our heart, so that we may never cease to remember the death (which cometh) in this world."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7329" value="I have never glorified myself, and I have never exalted myself."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7372" value="For this reason that which is written is fulfilled in me: 'He who exalteth himself shall be abased, and he who abaseth himself shall be exalted.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7475" value="Then Sebastianus was exceedingly wroth, and he said unto Apa Victor, 'Offer up sacrifice.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7523" value=" And Apa Victor answered and said, 'I will not offer up sacrifice."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7554" value="Whatsoever thou wishest to do unto me that do."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7589" value="I fell into the hands of the four torturers (?) before this, and I was not afraid of them, for the Lord gave me strength during all my torturings."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7698" value="Now therefore, O Duke, I was banished to this spot because of this Name, for (they said), 'Offer up sacrifice,'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7769" value="(and I would not  do so). And, moreover, I do not wish to remain in this world which shall dissolve away and perish."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7829" value="Be it known unto thee also, O Duke, that if thou put me to the torture many, many times, thou wilt only give additional strength to the reasoning power of the mind which is within me."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7949" value="Wholly fitting for me is it that I should be held worthy to endure revilings for the Name of the Christ.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8017" value="And the Duke said unto Apa Victor,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8045" value="Cease thy say; thou art always talking!"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8078" value="Art thou a deacon, or a reader, that thou possessest such perfect knowledge of this (kind) of  wisdom?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8152" value=" And Apa Victor said,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8167" value="I would give thanks unto the Christ (if I were), only I am not worthy of so great a gift as this — to be made a deacon or a reader. The grace of God is received through Jesus the Christ, Who giveth  wisdom unto every man whose heart is right with Him, because He is the giver of riches and His treasury is filled with wisdom (which) He giveth unto every one who shall  profit through Him in respect of good things."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8485" value="For as the good husbandman is in the habit of giving manure to his field, so that he may supply it with strength and enable it to bring forth its crop,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8585" value="even so doth the wisdom of God live in the soul of him that seeketh after it, and it permitteth neither the net of death nor the wiles of the Devil to have dominion over it. For the Lord is mighty, and He is able to perform everything.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8779" value="And the Duke said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8796" value="Dost thou then go so far as to choose for thyself death rather than life?"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8848" value=" And Apa Victor answered and said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8871" value="'This death is not by any means death, but life everlasting."/>
