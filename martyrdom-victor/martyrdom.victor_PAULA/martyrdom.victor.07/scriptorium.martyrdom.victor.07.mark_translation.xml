		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3537" value="he setteth the roof on the Scriptures.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3566" value="And the Duke said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3597" value="Cease thou to utter such words of folly as these,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3634" value="for these actions will profit  thee nothing, and thou shalt die. Thou art a child."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3706" value="Hearken unto me now; do thou offer up sacrifice so that I may set thee at liberty.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3751" value="And Apa Victor said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3775" value="'I am not a fool; nay, I am a wise man."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3815" value="If I were to hearken unto thee, and if I were to offer up sacrifice, I should in truth be a fool."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3867" value="Fools can never walk in the truth, because their hearts make them blind, and they become liars, like their father the Devil.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan3974" value="And the Duke was wroth, and he commanded (his servants) to tear out the intestines from his body down to his feet."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4053" value="And Apa Victor spake before the Duke, saying"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4099" value="The tendons, nerves, and sinews which thou hast dragged out from my body are like unto the pointed instruments where-  with (the physicians) probe a wound in order to liberate the fetid pus which is in it, and to give relief to the whole body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4260" value="That is the case with me at this moment."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4283" value="And now I will give thanks unto my Lord Jesus the Christ, for ever and ever. Amen.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4353" value="And the Duke made (his servants) bring some oil, and they lighted a fire under it, and kept it burning until the oil was boiling."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4416" value="And he made them pour it upon his necessary organs, and immediately the oil had been poured  upon them they fell off on the ground."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4514" value="And the blessed man Apa Victor answered and said, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4548" value="This oil which thou hast poured upon me is like unto the cool water which a man is wont to drink during the hot w^eather, and in which he washeth himself so that he may feel the relief thereof from the heat in his whole body.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4717" value="And the Duke commanded (his servants) to hoist him up on the rack of torture, and to stretch him thereon, and he made them put six burning torches close to his body; and they racked him for a period  of two hours. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4868" value="And the fire did not scorch his body in the least degree, for God was with him, and He gave him strength in all his tribulations."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan4976" value="And the Duke said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5008" value="O wicked head! I weary myself."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5032" value="I would spare thee from being put to shame, thou wilt not turn (i. e, repent)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5085" value="Come now, offer up sacrifice.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5130" value="And Apa Victor said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5163" value="Yesterday thou didst spare me; to-day spare thou me not."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5225" value="Do whatsoever it pleaseth thee to do unto me.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5254" value="And the Duke commanded (his servants) to pour vinegar and ashes into his mouth."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5313" value="And Apa Victor said,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5339" value="'This vinegar and these ashes, which thou makest me  to drink, are like unto honey dropped down my throat.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5436" value="Then the Duke commanded his servants to dig out his two eyes whilst he was alive."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5493" value="And straightway the executioners came and thrust red-hot knives into his eyes and ears"/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5661" value="And Apa Victor said unto the Duke,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5698" value="Even if thou  hast the power and dost make blind the eyes of my body, I have still left within me other eyes,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5794" value="that is to say, those of the mind and understanding, which will give me light, according to that which Peter the Apostle said"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan5869" value=" If it be that ye see with the eyes of the body, ye shall see the works of the world, which are vain, that is to say, fornication, and  slandering, and murder, and calumny, and pride, because of which things the wrath of God cometh.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6044" value="Therefore I have no need of the eyes of my body."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6089" value="And the Duke answered and said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6129" value="'If thou wilt compel me now to inflict further severe tortures upon thee, (I must do so).'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6200" value="And Apa Victor said unto him,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6226" value="Inflict upon me any punishment thou wishest to inflict"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6264" value="for I am  prepared to bear up under it. only take care to spare me not.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6316" value="Then the Duke commanded (his servants) to hang him up on a pillar head downwards"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6376" value="for three days and three nights, so that all his blood might pour out from his mouth and nostrils"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6419" value="and the soldiers who had hung him up departed to their houses, and left him hanging-."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6663" value="And Apa Victor said,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6690" value="In the Name of my God, for Whose sake I am suffering all these sufferings, receive ye your sight through (His) power, which  is holy; and straightway they received their sight."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6814" value="And when the Duke saw what had taken place,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6855" value="he commanded (the soldiers) to flay his body, and to tear out his tongue."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6909" value="And Apa Victor said unto the Duke,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan6946" value="Even though thou strippest off me my skin which is outside me, I have still  another skin, which is inside me, and which neither thy power nor thy tortures can injure."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7060" value="And again, though thou  shalt cut out my tongue, God is wont to perform judgement (on behalf of) those whose mouths are silenced."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7129" value="Now, therefore, I care nothing for thy tortures.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7173" value="And whilst the blessed man Apa Victor was saying these  things, behold, a certain young woman whose name was Stephanou, who was the wife of a soldier,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7271" value="looked out through her window — now she was about fifteen years of age — and  cried out, saying,"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7366" value="Blessed art thou, O Apa Victor, and  blessed art thou in all thy works."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7428" value="All thy sacrifices have been received from thy hands, even as were received the sacrifices of Abel, the righteous man, which he brought unto God in integrity of heart."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7539" value="God shall shew compassion upon thee as He did upon Enoch, the scribe of righteousness."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7599" value="Thou art perfect and righteous in thy generation as was Noah.'"/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7656" value="Thou dost believe on God, as did Abraham."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7700" value="Thou dost lay thy body on the altar as a sacrifice, as did Isaac."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7750" value="Thou dost manifest patient endurance, as did Jacob at the time when Esau pursued him (when he was) going to Laban."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7817" value="Thou art a man of wisdom and understanding, as was Daniel the Prophet."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7860" value="Thou hast been instructed in divine things by thy dreams like Joseph."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7907" value="Thou hast manifested patient endurance like Job, the man of God."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan7956" value="The Enemy hath been envious of thee as he was of Isaiah the Prophet, whose body they sawed in twain lengthwise with  a wood saw. And the fire hath not touched thee, even as the fire of Nebuchadnezzar touched not the Three Holy (Children)."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8129" value="Thou hast given thy heart unto God, even as did David, the son of Jesse."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan8189" value="Behold, I swear by thy  salvation, Apa Victor, that two crowns shall be sent down from heaven being borne by twenty-four angels"/>
