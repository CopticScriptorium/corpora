		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan138" value="My beloved in the Lord, before every other thing set humility in thy mouth when thou art ready to make answer, for, forgive me, thou knowest that by humility all the power of the Enemy is brought to naught. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan289" value="And thou knowest the goodness of thy Master, Whom they blasphemed, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan348" value="and how He became humble, and obedient, even unto death. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan399" value="And do thou thyself, my son, set thy humility in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy neck, for there is a commandment which inculcateth humility. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan508" value="Consider David, who boasted himself of his humility, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan548" value="and said, 'Because I humbled myself the Lord delivered me, and He did good unto me.' "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan624" value="My son, array thyself in humility, and thou shalt make the virtues of God be with thee."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1148" value="My son, these are the virtues of humility."/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan1185" value="My son, hold thy peace, for it is written, 'He who is wise at that time will hold his peace.' "/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2014" value="Let the one thou hast settled on be sufficient for thee, lest thou make him angry."/>

		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2253" value="Have no companionship with a restless and troublesome man, "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2289" value="and make thou thyself to continue in thy quiet life, and thou shalt not be in the mouth[s] of the brethren. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2342" value="I beseech thee, my beloved in the Lord, to let thy chief aim be to learn ; to hearken (or, obey) will give thee rest. "/>
		<feat xlink:href="#sSpan2403" value="For it is written, 'The profit of instruction is not silver.' "/>
